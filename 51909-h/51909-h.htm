      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hese stories are
      true in name and time and place. None of them in its incident happened as
      far away as three years ago. They were written to show you how the other
      half live&mdash;in New York. I had them direct from the veracious lips of
      the police. The gangsters themselves contributed sundry details.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will express amazement as you read that they carry so slight an
      element of Sing Sing and the Death Chair. Such should have been no doubt
      the very proper and lawful climax of more than one of them, and would were
      it not for what differences subsist between a moral and a legal certainty.
      The police know many things they cannot prove in court, the more when the
      question at bay concerns intimately, for life or death, a society where
      the &ldquo;snitch&rdquo; is an abomination and to &ldquo;squeal&rdquo; the single great offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, you are not to forget the politician, who in defense of a
      valuable repeater palsies police effort with the cold finger of his
      interference. With apologies to that order, the three links of the Odd
      Fellows are an example of the policeman, the criminal and the politician.
      The latter is the middle link, and holds the other two together while
      keeping them apart.

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;EAT-'EM-UP JACK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hick Tricker kept
      a house of call at One Hundred and Twenty-eight Park Row. There he sold
      strong drink, wine and beer, mostly beer, and the thirsty sat about at
      sloppy tables and enjoyed themselves. When night came there was music, and
      those who would&mdash;and could&mdash;arose and danced. One Hundred and
      Twenty-eight Park Row was in recent weeks abolished. The Committee of
      Fourteen, one of those restless moral influences so common in New York,
      complained to the Powers of Excise and had the license revoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mild February evening. The day shift had gone off watch at One
      Hundred and Twenty-eight, leaving the night shift in charge, and&mdash;all
      things running smoothly&mdash;Tricker decided upon an evening out. It
      might have been ten o'clock when, in deference to that decision, he
      stepped into the street. It was commencing to snow&mdash;flakes as big and
      soft and clinging as a baby's hand. Not that Tricker&mdash;hardy soul&mdash;much
      minded snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tricker, having notions about meeting Indian Louie, swung across to
      Roosevelt Street. Dodging down five steps, he opened the door of a dingy
      wine-cellar. It was the nesting-place of a bevy of street musicians, a
      dozen of whom were scattered about, quaffing chianti. Their harps, fiddles
      and hand-organs had been chucked into corners, and a general air of
      relaxation pervaded the scene. The room was blue with smoke, rich in the
      odor of garlic, and, since the inmates all talked at once, there arose a
      prodigious racket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near where Tricker seated himself reposed a hand-organ. Crouched against
      it was a little, mouse-hued monkey, fast asleep. The day's work had told
      on him. 'Fatigued of much bowing and scraping for coppers, the diminutive
      monkey slept soundly. Not all the hubbub served to shake the serene
      profundity of his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tricker idly gave the handle of the organ a twist. Perhaps three notes
      were elicited. It was enough. The little monkey was weary, but he knew the
      voice and heard in it a trumpet-call to duty. With the earliest squeak he
      sprang up&mdash;winking, blinking&mdash;and, doffing his small red hat,
      began begging for pennies. Tricker gave him a dime, not thinking it right
      to disturb his slumbers for nothing. The mouse-hued one tucked it away in
      some recondite pocket of his scanty jacket, and then, the organ having
      lapsed into silence, curled up for another snooze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tricker paid for his glass of wine, and&mdash;since he saw nothing of
      Indian Louie, and as a source of interest had exhausted the monkey&mdash;lounged
      off into the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Chatham Square Tricker met a big-chested policeman. Tricker knew the
      policeman, having encountered him officially. As the latter strutted
      along, a small, mustard-colored dog came crouching at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the dog for?&rdquo; Tricker asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in an easy mood, the trivial possessed a charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman bent upon the little dog a benign eye. The little dog
      glanced up shyly, wagging a wistful tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's lost,&rdquo; vouchsafed the policeman, &ldquo;and he's put it up to me to find
      out where he lives.&rdquo; He explained that all lost dogs make hot-foot for the
      nearest policeman. &ldquo;They know what a cop is for,&rdquo; said the big-chested
      one. Then, to the little dog: &ldquo;Come on, my son; we'll land you all right
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tricker continued his stroll. At Doyers Street and the Bowery he entered
      Barney Flynn's. There were forty customers hanging about. These loiterers
      were panhandlers of low degree; they were beneath the notice of Tricker,
      who was a purple patrician of the gangs. One of them could have lived all
      day on a quarter. It meant bed&mdash;ten cents&mdash;and three glasses of
      beer, each with a free lunch which would serve as a meal. Bowery beer is
      sold by the glass; but the glass holds a quart. The Bowery has refused to
      be pinched by the beer trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Flynn's was the eminent Chuck Connors, his head on his arm and his arm
      on a table. Intoxicated? Perish the thought! Merely taking his usual forty
      winks after dinner, which repast had consisted of four beef-stews. Tricker
      gave him a facetious thump on the back, but he woke in a bilious mood,
      full of haughtiness and cold reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a notable feature in Flynn's. The East Side is in its way
      artistic. Most of the places are embellished with pictures done on the
      walls, presumably by the old monsters of the <i>Police News</i>. On the
      rear wall of Flynn's is a portrait of Washington on a violent white horse.
      The Father of his Country is in conventional blue and buff, waving a
      vehement blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; demanded Proprietor Flynn of the artist, when first brought
      to bay by the violent one on the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; retorted the artist indignantly. &ldquo;Who should it be but
      Washin'ton, the Father of his Country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washin'ton?&rdquo; repeated Flynn. &ldquo;Who's Washin'ton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know who Washin'ton is? Say, you ought to go to night school!
      Washin'ton's th' duck who frees this country from th' English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' he bate th' English, did he? I can well be-lave it! Yez can see be
      th' face of him he's a brave man.&rdquo; Then, following a rapt silence: &ldquo;Say,
      I'll tell ye what! Paint me a dead Englishman right down there be his
      horse's fut, an' I'll give ye foor dollars more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The generous offer was accepted, and the foreground enriched with a dead
      grenadier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming out of Flynn's, Tricker went briefly into the Chinese Theater. The
      pig-tailed audience, sitting on the backs of the chairs with their feet in
      the wooden seats, were enjoying the performance hugely. Tricker listened
      to the dialogue but a moment; it was unsatisfactory and sounded like a
      cat-fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In finding his way out of Doyers Street, Tricker stopped for a moment in a
      little doggery from which came the tump-tump of a piano and the scuffle of
      a dance. The room, not thirty feet long, was cut in two by a ramshackle
      partition. On the grimy wall hung a placard which carried this moderate
      warning:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0018.jpg" alt="0018 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0018.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The management seemed to be in the hands of a morose personage, as red as
      a boiled lobster, who acted behind the bar. The piano was of that flat,
      tin-pan tone which bespeaks the veteran. It was drummed upon by a bleary
      virtuoso, who at sight of Tricker&mdash;for whose favor he yearned&mdash;began
      banging forth a hurly-burly that must have set on edge the teeth of every
      piano in the vicinity. The darky who was dancing redoubled his exertions.
      Altogether, Tricker's entrance was not without <i>éclat</i>. Not that he
      seemed impressed as, flinging himself into a chair, he listlessly called
      for apollinaris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do youse pay him?&rdquo; asked Tricker of the boiled barkeeper, indicating
      as he did so the hardworking colored person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pad-money!&rdquo;&mdash;with a slighting glance. &ldquo;Pad-money; an' it's twict too
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pad-money means pay for a bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should say so!&rdquo; coincided Tricker, with the weary yet lofty
      manner of one who is a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one corner were two women and a trio of men. The men were thieves of
      the cheap grade known as lush-workers. These beasts of prey lie about the
      East Side grog shops, and when some sailor ashore leaves a place, showing
      considerable slant, they tail him and take all he has. They will plunder
      their victim in sight of a whole street. No one will tell. The first
      lesson of Gangland is never to inform nor give evidence. One who does is
      called snitch; and the wages of the snitch is death. The lush-workers pay
      a percentage of their pillage, to what saloons they infest, for the
      privilege of lying in wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tricker pointed to the younger of the two women&mdash;about eighteen, she
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two years ago,&rdquo; said Tricker, addressing the boiled barman, &ldquo;I had her
      pinched an' turned over to the Aid Society. She's so young I thought mebby
      they could save her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save her!&rdquo; repeated the boiled one in weary disgust. &ldquo;Youse can't save
      'em. I used to try that meself. That was long ago. Now&rdquo;&mdash;tossing his
      hand with a resigned air&mdash;&ldquo;now, whenever I see a skirt who's goin' to
      hell, I pay her fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the three men was old and gray of hair. He used to be a gonoph, and
      had worked the rattlers and ferries in his youth. But he got settled a
      couple of times, and it broke his nerve. There is an age limit in
      pocket-picking. No pickpocket is good after he passes forty years; so far,
      Dr. Osier was right. Children from twelve to fourteen do the best work.
      Their hands are small and steady; their confidence has not been shaken by
      years in prison. There are twenty New York Fagins&mdash;the police use the
      Dickens name&mdash;training children to pick pockets. These Fagins have
      dummy subjects faked up, their garments covered with tiny bells. The
      pockets are filled&mdash;watch, purse, card-case, handkerchief, gloves.
      Not until a pupil can empty every pocket, without ringing a bell, is he
      fit to go out into the world and look for boobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Indian Louie shows up,&rdquo; remarked Tricker to the boiled-lobster barman,
      as he made ready to go, &ldquo;tell him to blow 'round tomorry evenin' to One
      Hundred and Twenty-eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Working his careless way back to the Bowery, Tricker strolled north to
      where that historic thoroughfare merges into Third Avenue. In Great Jones
      Street, round the corner from Third Avenue, Paul Kelly kept the New
      Brighton. Tricker decided to look in casually upon this hall of mirth, and&mdash;as
      one interested&mdash;study trade conditions. True, there was a coolness
      between himself and Kelly, albeit, both being of the Five Points, they
      were of the same tribe. What then? As members of the gang nobility, had
      they not won the right to nurse a private feud? De Bracy and Bois Guilbert
      were both Crusaders, and yet there is no record of any lost love between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the roll of gang honor Kelly's name was written high. Having been
      longer and more explosively before the public, his fame was even greater
      than Tricker's. There was, too, a profound background of politics to the
      New Brighton. It was strong with Tammany Hall, and, per incident, in right
      with the police. For these double reasons of Kelly's fame, and that
      atmosphere of final politics which invested it, the New Brighton was
      deeply popular. Every foot of dancing floor was in constant demand, while
      would-be merry-makers, crowded off for want of room, sat in a triple
      fringe about the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along one side of the dancing room was ranged a row of tables. A young
      person, just struggling into gang notice, relinquished his chair at one of
      these to Tricker. This was in respectful recognition of the exalted
      position in Gangland held by Tricker. Tricker unbent toward the young
      person in a tolerant nod, and accepted his submissive politeness as though
      doing him a favor. Tricker was right. His notice, even such as it was,
      graced and illustrated the polite young person in the eyes of all who
      beheld it, and identified him as one of whom the future would hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every East Side dance hall has a sheriff, who acts as floor manager and
      settles difficult questions of propriety. It often happens that, in an
      excess of ardor and a paucity of room, two couples in their dancing seek
      to occupy the same space on the floor. He who makes two blades of grass
      grow where but one grew before, may help his race and doubtless does. The
      rule, however, stops with grass and does not reach to dancing. He who
      tries to make two couples dance, where only one had danced before, but
      lays the bed-plates of a riot. Where all the gentlemen are spirited, and
      the ladies even more so, the result is certain in its character, and in no
      wise hard to guess. Wherefore the dance hall sheriff is not without a
      mission. Likewise his honorable post is full of peril, and he must be of
      the stern ore from which heroes are forged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff of the New Brighton was Eat-'Em-Up-Jack McManus. He had been a
      prize-fighter of more or less inconsequence, but a liking for mixed ale
      and a difficulty in getting to weight had long before cured him of that.
      He had won his <i>nom de guerre</i> on the battle-field, where good
      knights were wont to win their spurs. Meeting one of whose conduct he
      disapproved, he had criticized the offender with his teeth, and thereafter
      was everywhere hailed as Eat-'Em-Up-Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eat-'Em-Up-Jack wore his honors modestly, as great souls ever do, and
      there occurred nothing at the New Brighton to justify that re-baptism.
      There he preserved the proprieties with a black-jack, and never once
      brought his teeth into play. Did some boor transgress, Eat-'Em-Up-Jack
      collared him, and cast him into the outer darkness of Great Jones Street.
      If the delinquent foolishly resisted, Eat-'Em-Up-Jack emphasized that
      dismissal with his boot. In extreme instances he smote upon him with a
      black-jack&mdash;ever worn ready on his wrist, although delicately hidden,
      when not upon active service, in his coat sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tricker, drinking seltzer and lemon, sat watching the dancers as they
      swept by. He himself was of too grave a cast to dance; it would have
      mismatched with his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eat-'Em-Up-Jack, who could claim social elevation by virtue of his being
      sheriff, came and stood by Tricker's table. The pair greeted one another.
      Their manner, while marked of a careful courtesy, was distant and owned
      nothing of warmth. The feuds of Kelly were the feuds of Eat-'Em-Up-Jack,
      and the latter knew that Tricker and Kelly stood not as brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Eat-'Em-Up-Jack paused by Tricker's table, passing an occasional remark
      with that visitor from Park Row, Bill Harrington with Goldie Cora whirled
      by on the currents of the <i>Beautiful Blue Danube</i>. Tricker's expert
      tastes rejected with disfavor the dancing of Goldie Cora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like the way she t'rows her feet,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Goldie Cora was the belle of the New Brighton. Moreover,
      Eat-'Em-Up-Jack liked the way she threw her feet, and was honest in his
      admiration. As much might be said of Harrington, who had overheard
      Tricker's remark. Eat-'Em-Up-Jack, defending his own judgment, declared
      that Goldie Cora was the sublimation of grace, and danced like a leaf in a
      puff of wind. He closed by discrediting not only the opinion but the
      parentage of Tricker, and advised him to be upon his way lest worse happen
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beat it, before I bump me black-jack off your bean!&rdquo; was the way it was
      sternly put by Eat-'Em-Up-Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tricker, cool and undismayed, waved his hand as though brushing aside a
      wearisome insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can that black-jack guff,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Un'er-stan'; your bein' a
      fighter don't get youse nothin' wit' me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington came up. Having waltzed the entire length of the <i>Beautiful
      Blue Danube</i>, he had abandoned Goldie Cora, and was now prepared to
      personally resent the imputation inherent in Tricker's remark anent that
      fair one's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He don't like the way you t'row your feet, eh? I'll make him like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus spake Harrington to Goldie Cora, as he turned from her to seek out
      Tricker.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Gangland is not so ceremonious as to demand that you lead the lady to
      a seat. Dance ended, it is good form to leave her sticking in the furrow,
      even as a farmer might his plow, and walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrington bitterly added his views to Eat-'Em-Up-Jack's, and something
      was said about croaking Tricker then and there. The threats of Harrington,
      as had those of Eat-'Em-Up-Jack, glanced off the cool surface of Tricker
      like the moon's rays off a field of ice. He was sublimely indifferent, and
      didn't so much as get off his chair. Only his right hand stole under his
      coat-skirt in an unmistakable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you big stiff! w'at be youse tryin' to give me?&rdquo; was his only
      separate notice of Harrington. Then, to both: &ldquo;Unless you guys is lookin'
      to give th' coroner a job, youse won't start nothin' here. Take it from me
      that, w'en I'm bounced out of a dump like this, the bouncin' 'll come off
      in th' smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eat-'Em-Up-Jack, being neither so quick nor so eloquent as Tricker, could
      only retort, &ldquo;That's all right! I'll hand you yours before I'm done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington, after his first outbreak, said nothing, being privily afraid
      of Tricker, and more or less held by the spell of his fell repute.
      Eat-'Em-Up-Jack, who feared no man, was kept in check by his obligations
      as sheriff&mdash;that, and a sense of duty. True, the situation irked him
      sorely; he felt as though he were in handcuffs. But the present was no
      common case. Tricker would shoot; and a hail of lead down the length of
      the dancing floor meant loss in dollars and cents. This last was something
      which Kelly, always a business man and liking money, would be the first to
      condemn and the last to condone. It would black-eye the place; since few
      care to dance where the ballroom may become a battle-field and bullets zip
      and sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was only later!&rdquo; said Eat-'Em-Up Jack, wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later?&rdquo; retorted Tricker. &ldquo;That's easy. You close at one, an' that's ten
      minutes from now. Let the mob make its getaway; an' after that youse ducks
      'll find me waitin' 'round the corner in Thoid Avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tricker, manner nonchalant to the point of insult, loitered to the door,
      pausing on his way to take a leisurely drink at the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dubs,&rdquo; he called back, as he stepped out into Great Jones Street,
      &ldquo;better bring your gatts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gatts is East Sidese for pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrington didn't like the looks of things. He was sorry, he said,
      addressing Eat-'Em-Up-Jack, but he wouldn't be able to accompany him to
      that Third Avenue tryst. He must see Goldie Cora home. The Police had just
      issued an order, calculated invidiously to inconvenience and annoy every
      lady found in the streets after midnight unaccompanied by an escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eat-'Em-Up-Jack hardly heard him. Personally he wouldn't have turned hand
      or head to have had the company of a dozen Harringtons. Eat-'Em-Up-Jack,
      while lacking many things, lacked not at all in heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Brighton closed in due time. Eat-'Em-Up-Jack waited until sure the
      junction of Great Jones Street and Third Avenue was quite deserted. As he
      came 'round the corner, gun in hand, Tricker&mdash;watchful as a cat&mdash;stepped
      out of a stairway. There was a blazing, rattling fusillade&mdash;twelve
      shots in all. When the shooting was at an end, Eat-'Em-Up-Jack had
      vanished. Tricker, save for a reason, would have followed his vanishing
      example; there was a bullet embedded in the calf of his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tricker hopped painfully into a stairway, where he might have advantage of
      the double gloom. He had lighted a cigarette, and was coolly leaning
      against the entrance, when two policemen came running up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that shooting?&rdquo; demanded one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a couple of geeks started to hand it to each other,&rdquo; was Tricker's
      careless reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did either get hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of 'em cops it in th' leg. Th' other blew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of the one who's copped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, him? He hops into one of th' stairways along here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officers didn't see the spreading pool of blood near Tricker's foot.
      They hurried off to make a ransack of the stairways, while Tricker hobbled
      out to a cab he had signaled, and drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-four hours later!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a block from where he'd fought his battle with Tricker,
      Eat-'Em-Up-Jack was walking in Third Avenue. He was as lone as Lot's wife;
      for he nourished misanthropic sentiments and discouraged company. It was a
      moonless night and very dark, the snow still coming down. What with the
      storm and the hour, the streets were as empty as a church.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Eat-'Em-Up-Jack passed the building farthest from the corner lamp, a
      crouching figure stepped out of the doorway. Had it been two o'clock in
      the afternoon, instead of two o'clock in the morning, you would have seen
      that he of the crouching figure was smooth and dark-skinned as to face,
      and that his blue-black hair had been cut after a tonsorial fashion
      popular along the Bowery as the Guinea Lop. The crouching one carried in
      his hand what seemed to be a rolled-up newspaper. In that rolled-up paper
      lay hidden a two-foot piece of lead pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crouching blue-black one crept after Eat-'Em-Up-Jack, making no more
      noise than a cat. He uplifted the lead pipe, grasping it the while with
      both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eat-'Em-Up-Jack, as unaware of his peril as of what was passing in the
      streets of Timbuctoo, slouched heavily forward, deep in thought, Perhaps
      he was considering a misspent youth, and chances thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lead pipe came down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dull crash, and Eat-'Em-Up-Jack&mdash;without word or cry&mdash;fell
      forward on his face. Blood ran from mouth and ears, and melted redly into
      the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crouching blue-black one shrank back into the stairway, and was seen
      no more. The street returned to utter emptiness. There remained only the
      lifeless body of Eat-'Em-Up-jack. Nothing beyond, save the softly falling
      veil of snow, with the street lamps shining through.

      II.&mdash;THE BABY'S FINGERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a Central
      Office man who told me how the baby lost its fingers. I like Central
      Office men; they live romances and have adventures. The man I most shrink
      from is your dull, proper individual to whom nothing happens. You have
      seen a hundred such. Rigidly correct, they go uneventfully to and fro upon
      their little respectable tracks. Evenings, from the safe yet severe
      vantage of their little respectable porches, they pass judgment upon
      humanity from across the front fence. After which, they go inside and
      weary their wives with their tasteless, pale society, while those
      melancholy matrons question themselves, in a spirit of tacit despair,
      concerning the blessings of matrimony. In the end, first thanking heaven
      that they are not as other men, they retire to bed, to rise in the dawning
      and repeat the history of every pulseless yesterday of their existence.
      Nothing ever overtakes them that doesn't overtake a clam. They are
      interesting, can be interesting, to no one save themselves. To talk with
      one an hour is like being lost in the desert an hour. I prefer people into
      whose lives intrudes some element of adventure, and who, as they roll out
      of their blankets in the morning, cannot give you, word and minute, just
      what they will be saying and doing every hour in the coming twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Central Office friend, in telling of the baby's absent fingers, began
      by speaking of Johnny Spanish. Spanish has been sent to prison for no less
      than seven years. Dribben and Blum arrested him, and when the next morning
      he was paraded at the Central Office looking-over, the speech made upon
      him by Commissioner Flynn set a resentful pulse to beating in his swarthy
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that Spanish had been arrested for the baby's lost fingers. That story
      in the telling came later, although the wrong it registered had happened
      months before. Dribben and Blum picked him up&mdash;as a piece of work it
      did them credit&mdash;for what occurred in Mersher Miller's place.
    </p>
    <p>
      As all the world knows, Mersher Miller, or as he is called among his
      intimates, Mersher the Strong-Arm, conducts a beer house at 171 Norfolk
      Street. It was a placid April evening, and Mersher's brother, as
      bottle-tosser, was busy behind the bar. Mersher himself was not in, which&mdash;for
      Mersher&mdash;may or may not have been greatly to the good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish came into the place. His hat was low-drawn over his black eyes.
      Mersher's brother, wiping glasses, didn't know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Mersher?&rdquo; asked Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; quoth Mersher's brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll do,&rdquo; returned Spanish. &ldquo;Give me ten dollars out of the damper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mersher's brother held this proposal in finance to be foolishly
      impossible, and was explicit on that head. He insisted, not without scorn,
      that he was the last man in the world to give a casual caller ten dollars
      out of the damper or anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be back,&rdquo; replied Spanish, &ldquo;an' I bet then you'll give me that
      ten-spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Johnny Spanish,&rdquo; declared a bystander, when Spanish, muttering his
      discontent, had gone his threatening way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mersher's brother doubted it. He had heard of Spanish, but had never seen
      him. It was his understanding that Spanish was not in town at all, having
      lammistered some time before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's wanted be th' cops,&rdquo; Mersher's brother argued. &ldquo;You don't suppose
      he's sucker enough to walk into their mitts? He wouldn't dare show up in
      town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't con yourself,&rdquo; replied the bystander, who had a working knowledge
      of Gangland and its notables. &ldquo;That's Spanish, all right. He was out of
      town, but not because of the bulls. It's the Dropper he's leary of; an'
      now th' Dropper's in hock he's chased back. You heard what he said about
      comin' 'round ag'in? Take my tip an' rib yourself up wit' a rod. That
      Spanish is a tough kid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evening wore on at Mersher's; one hour, two hours, three went
      peaceably by. The clock pointed to eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without warning a lowering figure appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; exclaimed the learned bystander. Then he added with a note
      of pride, albeit shaky as to voice: &ldquo;What did I tell youse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The figure in the doorway strode forward. It was Spanish. A second figure&mdash;hat
      over eyes&mdash;. followed hard on his heels. With a flourish, possible
      only to the close student of Mr. Beadle's dime literature, Spanish drew
      two Colt's pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come through wit' that ten!&rdquo; said he to Mersher's brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mersher's brother came through, and came through swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so!&rdquo; sneered Spanish, showing his side teeth like a dog whose
      feelings have been hurt. &ldquo;Now come through wit' th' rest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mersher's brother eagerly gave him the contents of the cash drawer&mdash;about
      eighty dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish, having pocketed the money, wheeled upon the little knot of
      customers, who, after the New York manner when crime is afoot, had stood
      motionless with no thought of interfering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands up! Faces to the wall!&rdquo; cried Spanish. &ldquo;Everybody's dough looks
      good to me to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The customers, acting in such concert that it seemed as though they'd been
      rehearsed, hands held high, turned their faces to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep them covered,&rdquo; said Spanish to his dark companion in arms,
      &ldquo;while I go through 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark companion leveled his own pistol in a way calculated to do the
      most harm, and Spanish reaped an assortment of cheap watches and a handful
      of bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish came round on Mersher's brother. The latter had stooped down until
      his eyes were on a par with the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Spanish to Mersher's brother, &ldquo;I might as well cook you. I've
      no use for barkeeps, anyway, an' besides you're built like a pig an' I
      don't like your looks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spanish began to shoot, and Mersher's brother began to dodge. Ducking and
      dodging, the latter ran the length of the bar, Spanish faithfully
      following with his bullets. There were two in the ice box, two through the
      mirror, five in the top of the bar. Each and all, they had been too late
      for Mersher's brother, who, pale as a candle, emerged from the bombardment
      breathing heavily but untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' this,&rdquo; cried Ikey the pawnbroker, ten minutes after Spanish had
      disappeared&mdash;Ikey was out a red watch and sixty dollars&mdash;&ldquo;an'
      this iss vat Mayor Gaynor calls 'outvard order an' decency'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was upon the identification of the learned bystander that Dribben and
      Blum went to work, and it was for that stick-up in Mersher's the two made
      the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's lucky for you guys,&rdquo; said Spanish, his eye sparkling venomously like
      the eye of a snake&mdash;&ldquo;it's lucky for you guys that you got me wit'out
      me guns. I'd have croaked one of you bulls sure, an' maybe both, an' then
      took th' Dutch way out me-self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dutch way out, with Spanish and his immediate circle, means suicide,
      it being a belief among them that the Dutch are a melancholy brood, and
      favor suicide as a means of relief when the burdens of life become more
      than they can bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish, however, did not have his gun when he was pinched, and therefore
      did not croak Dribben and Blum, and do the Dutch act for himself. Dribben
      and Blum are about their daily duties as thief takers, as this is read,
      while Spanish is considering nature from between the Sing Sing bars.
      Dribben and Blum say that, even if Spanish had had his guns, he would
      neither have croaked them nor come near it, and in what bluffs he put up
      to that lethal effect he was talking through his hat. For myself, I say
      nothing, neither one way nor the other, except that Dribben and Blum are
      bold and enterprising officers, and Spanish is the very heart of
      quenchless desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      By word of my Central Office informant, Spanish has seen twenty-two years
      and wasted most of them. His people dwell somewhere in the wilds of Long
      Island, and are as respectable as folk can be on two dollars a day.
      Spanish did not live with his people, preferring the city, where he cut a
      figure in Suffolk, Norfolk, Forsyth, Hester, Grand, and other East Side
      avenues.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time Spanish had a gallery number, and his picture held an
      important place in Central Office regard. It was taken out during what
      years the inadequate Bingham prevailed as Commissioner of Police. A row
      arose over a youth named Duffy, who was esteemed by an eminent Judge.
      Duffy's picture was in the gallery, and the judge demanded its removal. It
      being inconvenient to refuse the judge, young Duffy's picture was taken
      out; and since to make fish of one while making flesh of others might have
      invited invidious comment, some hundreds of pictures&mdash;among them that
      of Spanish&mdash;were removed at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pleased Spanish vastly when his mug came out of the gallery. Not that
      its presence there was calculated to hurt his standing; not but what it
      was bound to go back as a certain incident of his method of life. Its
      removal was a wound to police vanity; and, hating the police, he found joy
      in whatsoever served to wring their azure withers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, according to the rules of Bertillon, Spanish was thumb-printed,
      mugged and measured, the police described him on their books as Pickpocket
      and Fagin. The police affirmed that he not only worked the Broadway
      rattlers in his own improper person, but&mdash;paying a compliment to his
      genius for organization&mdash;that he had drawn about himself a group of
      children and taught them to steal for his sinful use. It is no more than
      truth to say, however, that never in New York City was Spanish convicted
      as either a Fagin or a pickpocket, and the police&mdash;as he charges&mdash;may
      have given him these titles as a cover for their ignorance, which some
      insist is of as deep an indigo as the hue of their own coats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish was about seventeen when he began making an East Side stir. He did
      not yearn to be respectable. He had borne witness to the hard working
      respectability of his father and mother, and remembered nothing as having
      come from it more than aching muscles and empty pockets. Their clothes
      were poor, their house was poor, their table poor. Why should he fret
      himself with ideals of the respectable?
    </p>
    <p>
      Work?
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn't pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his blood, too, flowed malignant cross-currents, which swept him
      towards idleness and all manner of violences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the lesson of the hour train him in selfrestraint. All over New
      York City, in Fifth Avenue, at the Five Points, the single cry was, Get
      the Money! The rich were never called upon to explain their prosperity.
      The poor were forever being asked to give some legal reason for their
      poverty. Two men in a magistrate's court are fined ten dollars each. One
      pays, and walks free; the other doesn't, and goes to the Island. Spanish
      sees, and hears, and understands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cries he, &ldquo;that boob went to the Island not for what he did but for
      not having ten bones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the lesson of that thunderous murmur&mdash;reaching from the Battery
      to Kingsbridge&mdash;of Get the Money! rushes upon him; and he makes up
      his mind to heed it. Also, there are uncounted scores like Spanish, and
      other uncounted scores with better coats than his, who are hearing and
      seeing and reasoning the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish stood but five feet three, and his place was among the
      lightweights. Such as the Dropper, who tilted the scales at 180, and whose
      name of Dropper had been conferred upon him because every time he hit a
      man he dropped him&mdash;such as Ike the Blood, as hard and heavy as the
      Dropper and whose title of the Blood had not been granted in any spirit of
      factitiousness&mdash;laughed at him. What matter that his heart was high,
      his courage proof? Physically, he could do nothing with these dangerous
      ones&mdash;as big as dangerous! And so, ferociously ready to even things
      up, he began packing a rod.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Spanish, proceeding as best he might by his dim standards, was
      struggling for gang eminence and dollars, Alma, round, dark, vivacious,
      eyes as deep and soft and black as velvet, was the unchallenged belle of
      her Williamsburg set. Days she worked as a dressmaker, without getting
      rich. Nights she went to rackets, which are dances wide open and unfenced.
      Sundays she took in picnics, or rode up and down on the trolleys&mdash;those
      touring cars of the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish met Alma and worshipped her, for so was the world made. Being thus
      in love, while before he, Spanish, had only needed money, now he had to
      have it. For love's price to a man is money, just as its price to a woman
      is tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casting about for ways and means, Spanish's money-hunting eye fell upon
      Jigger. Jigger owned a stuss-house in Forsyth Street, between Hester and
      Grand. Jigger was prosperous beyond the dreams of avarice. Multitudes,
      stabbing stuss, thronged his temple of chance. As a quick, sure way to
      amass riches, Spanish decided to become Jigger's partner. Between them
      they would divide the harvest of Forsyth Street stuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The golden beauty of the thought lit up the dark face of Spanish with a
      smile that was like a splash of vicious sunshine. Alma, in the effulgence
      of her toilets, should overpower all rivalry! At rout and racket, he,
      Spanish, would lead the hard walk with her, and she should shine out upon
      Gangland fashion like a fire in a forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      His soul having wallowed itself weary in these visions, Spanish sought
      Jigger as a step towards making the visions real. Spanish and his
      proposition met with obstruction. Jigger couldn't see it, wouldn't have
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish was neither astonished nor dismayed. He had foreseen the Jiggerian
      reluctance, and was organized to break it down. When Jigger declined his
      proffered partnership&mdash;in which he, Jigger, must furnish the capital
      while Spanish contributed only his avarice&mdash;and asked, &ldquo;Why should
      I?&rdquo; he, Spanish, was ready with an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you?&rdquo; and Spanish repeated Jigger's question so that his reply
      might have double force. &ldquo;Because, if you don't, I'll bump youse off.&rdquo;
       Gangland is so much like Missouri that you must always be prepared to show
      it. Gangland takes nothing on trust. And, if you try to run a bluff, it
      calls you. Spanish wore a low-browed, sullen, sour look. But he had killed
      no one, owned no dread repute, and Jigger was used to sullen, sour,
      lowbrowed looks. Thus, when Spanish spoke of bumping Jigger off, that
      courtier of fortune, full of a case-hardened scepticism, laughed low and
      long and mockingly. He told the death-threatening Spanish to come
      a-running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish didn't come a-running, but he came much nearer it than Jigger
      liked. Crossing up with the perverse Jigger the next evening, at the
      corner of Forsyth and Grand, he opened upon that obstinate stuss dealer
      with a Colt's-38. Jigger managed to escape, but little Sadie Rotin, <i>otat</i>
      eight, was killed. Jigger, who was unarmed, could not return the fire.
      Spanish, confused and flurried, doubtless, by the poor result of his
      gun-play, betook himself to flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police did not get Spanish; but in Gangland the incident did him
      little good. At the Ajax Club, and in other places where the best blood of
      the gangs was wont to unbuckle and give opinions, such sentiment-makers as
      the Dropper, Ike the Blood, Kid Kleiney, Little Beno, Fritzie Rice, Kid
      Strauss, the Humble Dutchman, Zamo, and the Irish Wop, held but one view.
      Such slovenly work was without precedent as without apology. To miss
      Jigger aroused ridicule. But to go farther, and kill a child playing in
      the street, spelled bald disgrace. Thereafter no self-respecting lady
      would drink with Spanish, no gentleman of gang position would return his
      nod. He would be given the frozen face at the rackets, the icy eye in the
      streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, his few friends, contending feebly, insisted that it wasn't
      Spanish who had killed the little Rotin girl. When Spanish cracked off his
      rod at Jigger, others had caught the spirit. A half dozen guns&mdash;they
      said&mdash;had been set blazing; and it was some unknown practitioner who
      had shot down the little Rotin girl. What were the heart-feelings of
      father and mother Rotin, to see their baby killed, did not appeal as a
      question to either the friends or foes of Spanish. Gangland is interested
      only in dollars or war.
    </p>
    <p>
      That contention of his friends did not restore Spanish in the general
      estimation. All must confess that at least he had missed Jigger. And
      Jigger without a rod! It crowded hard upon the unbelievable, and could be
      accounted for only upon the assumption that Spanish was rattled, which is
      worse than being scared. Mere fear might mean no more than an excess of
      prudence. To get rattled, everywhere and under all conditions, is the mean
      sure mark of weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      While discussion, like a pendulum, went swinging to and fro, Spanish&mdash;possibly
      a-smart from what biting things were being said in his disfavor&mdash;came
      to town, and grievously albeit casually shot an unknown. Following which
      feat he again disappeared. None knew where he had gone. His whereabouts
      was as much a mystery as the identity of the unknown whom he had shot, or
      the reason he had shot him. These two latter questions are still borne as
      puzzles upon the ridge of gang conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this time he had hit his man, however, lifted Spanish somewhat from
      out those lower reputational depths into which missing Jigger had cast
      him. The unknown, to be sure, did not die; the hospital books showed that.
      But he had stopped a bullet. Which last proved that Spanish wasn't always
      rattled when he pulled a gun. The incident, all things considered, became
      a trellis upon which the reputation of Spanish, before so prone and
      hopeless, began a little to climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strenuous life doesn't always blossom and bear good fruit. Balked in
      his intended partnership with Jigger, and subsequently missing Jigger&mdash;to
      say nothing of the business of the little Rotin girl, dead and down under
      the grass roots&mdash;Spanish not only failed to Get the Money! but
      succeeded in driving himself out of town. Many and vain were the gang
      guesses concerning him. Some said he was in Detroit, giving professional
      aid to a gifted booster. The latter was of the feminine gender, and, aside
      from her admitted genius for shoplifting, was acclaimed the quickest hand
      with a hanger&mdash;by which you are to understand that outside pendant
      purse wherewith women equip themselves as they go forth to shop&mdash;of
      all the gon-molls between the two oceans. Others insisted that Spanish was
      in Baltimore, and had joined out with a mob of poke-getters. The great,
      the disastrous thing, however&mdash;and to this all Gangland agreed&mdash;was
      that he had so bungled his destinies as to put himself out of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Detroit! Baltimore!&rdquo; exclaimed the Dropper. &ldquo;W'y, it's woise'n bein' in
      stir! A guy might as well be doin' time as live in them burgs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dropper, in his iron-fisted way, was sincere in what he said. Later,
      he himself was given eighteen spaces in Sing Sing, which exile he might
      have missed had he fled New York in time. But he couldn't, and didn't. And
      so the Central Office got him, the District Attorney prosecuted him, the
      jury convicted him, and the judge sentenced him to that long captivity.
      Living in New York is not a preference, but an appetite&mdash;like
      drinking whiskey&mdash;and the Dropper had acquired the habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the Dropper settled for?
    </p>
    <p>
      Robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's too long to tell here, however, besides being another story. Some
      other day I may give it to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish, having abandoned New York, could no longer bear Alma loving
      company at picnic, rout and racket. What was Alma to do? She lived for
      routs, reveled in rackets, joyed in picnics. Must these delights be swept
      away? She couldn't go alone&mdash;it was too expensive. Besides, it would
      evince a lack of class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma, as proud and as wedded to her social position as any silken member
      of the Purple and Fine Linen Gang that ever rolled down Fifth Avenue in
      her brougham, revolved these matters upon her wheel of thought. Also, she
      came to conclusions. She, an admitted belle, could not consent to social
      obliteration. Spanish had fled; she worshipped his black eyes, his high
      courage; she would keep a heart-corner vacant for him in case he came
      back. Pending his return, however, she would go into society; and, for
      those reasons of expense and class and form, she would not go alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma submitted her position to a beribboned jury of her peers. Their
      judgment ran abreast of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A goil would be a mutt,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;to stay cocked up at home. An' yet a
      goil couldn't go chasin' around be her lonesome. Alma&rdquo;&mdash;this was
      their final word&mdash;&ldquo;you must cop off another steady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what would Johnny say?&rdquo; asked Alma; for she couldn't keep her
      thoughts off Spanish, of whom she stood a little bit in fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny's beat it, ain't he?&rdquo; returned the advisory jury of friends.
      &ldquo;There ain't no kick comin' to a guy what's beat it. He ain't no longer in
      th' picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alma, thus free to pick and choose by virtue of the absence of Spanish,
      picked the Dropper. The latter chieftain was flattered. Taking Alma
      proudly yet tenderly under his mighty arm, he led her to suppers such as
      she had never eaten, bought her drinks such as she had never tasted,
      revolved with her at rackets where tickets were a dollar a throw, the
      orchestra seven pieces, and the floor shone like glass. It was a cut or
      two above anything that Spanish had given her, and Alma, who thought it
      going some, failed not to say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma was proud of the Dropper; the Dropper was proud of her. She told her
      friends of the money he spent; and the friends warmed the cockles of her
      little heart by shrilly exclaiming at pleasant intervals:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't he th' swell guy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betcher boots he's th' swell guy,&rdquo; Alma would rejoin; &ldquo;an' he's got money
      to boin a wet dog! Th' only t'ing that worries me,&rdquo; Alma would conclude,
      &ldquo;is Johnny. S'ppose he blows in some day, an' lays for th' Dropper?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' Dropper could do him wit' a wallop,&rdquo; the friends would consolingly
      return. &ldquo;He'd swing onct; an' after that there wouldn't be no Johnny
      Spanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Round Back Rangers&mdash;it was, I think, the Round Backs&mdash;gave
      an outdoor racket somewhere near Maspeth. The Dropper took Alma. Both were
      in high, exultant feather. They danced, they drank, they rode the wooden
      horses. No more gallant couple graced the grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheese sandwiches, pig's knuckles and beer brought them delicately to the
      banquet board. They were among their friends. The talk was always
      interesting, sometimes educational.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ike the Blood complained that certain annoying purists were preaching a
      crusade against the Raines Law Hotels. Slimmy, celebrated not only for his
      slimness, but his erudition, declared that crusades had been the common
      curse of every age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at do youse know about it?&rdquo; sourly propounded the Humble Dutchman, who
      envied Slimmy his book-fed wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at do I know about it?&rdquo; came heatedly from Slimmy. &ldquo;Do youse think I
      ain't got no education? Th' last time I'm in stir, that time I goes up for
      four years, I reads all th' books in th' prison library. Ask th' warden if
      I don't. As to them crusades, it's as I tells you. There's always been
      crusades; it's th' way humanity's gaited. Every sport, even if he don't go
      'round blowin' about it, has got it tucked somewhere away in his make-up
      that he, himself, is th' real thing. Every dub who's different from him he
      figgers is worse'n him. In two moves he's out crusadin'. In th' old days
      it's religion; th' Paynims was th' fall guys. Now it's rum, or racin', or
      Raines Hotels, or some such stall. Once let a community get the crusade
      bug, an' something's got to go. There's a village over in Joisey, an,'
      there bein' no grog shops an' no vice mills to get busy wit', they ups an'
      bounces an old geezer out of th' only church in town for pitchin'
      horse-shoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slimmy called for more beer, with a virtuously superior air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about them Paynims, Slimmy?&rdquo; urged Alma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's hundreds of years ago,&rdquo; Slimmy resumed. &ldquo;Th' Paynims hung out in
      Palestine. Bein' they're Paynims, the Christians is naturally sore on 'em;
      an' so, when they feels like huntin' trouble, th' crusade spirit'd flare
      up. Richard over in England would pass th' woid to Philip in France, an'
      th' other lads wit' crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How about it?' he'd say. 'Cast your regal peepers toward Palestine.
      D'you make them Paynims? Ain't they th' tough lot? They won't eat pork;
      they toe in when they walk; they don't drink nothin' worse'n coffee;
      they've got brown skins. Also,' says he, 'we can lick 'em for money,
      marbles or chalk. W'at d'youse say, me royal brothers? Let's get our
      gangs, an' hand them Paynims a swift soak in behalf of the troo faith.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip an' the other crowned lads at this would agree wit' Richard. 'Them
      Paynims is certainly th' worst ever!' they'd say; an' one woid'd borry
      another, until the crusade is on. Some afternoon you'd hear the newsies in
      th' streets yellin', 'Wux-try!' an' there it'd be in big black type,
      'Richard, Philip an' their gallant bands of Strong-Arms have landed in
      Palestine.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' then w'at, Slimmy?&rdquo; cooed Alma, who hung on every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I can see, th' Christians always had it on th' Paynims, always
      had 'em shaded, when it comes to a scrap. Th' Christian lads had th'
      punch; an' th' Paynims must have been wise to it; for no sooner would
      Richard, Philip an' their roly-boly boys hit th' dock, than th' Paynims
      would take it on th' run for th' hills. Their mullahs would try to rally
      'em, be tellin' 'em that whoever got downed fightin' Christians, the
      prophet would punch his ticket through for paradise direct, an' no
      stop-overs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's all right about the prophet!' they'd say, givin' th' mullahs th'
      laugh. An' then they'd beat it for th' next ridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them Paynims must have been a bunch of dead ones,&rdquo; commented the Dropper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bein' able to get on a match,&rdquo; continued Slimmy, without heeding the
      Dropper, &ldquo;th' Paynims declinin' their game, th' Christian hosts would
      rough house th' country generally, an' in a way of speakin' stand th' Holy
      Land on its head. Do what they would, however, they couldn't coax th'
      Paynims into th' ring wit' 'em; an' so after a while they decides that
      Palestine's th' bummest place they'd ever struck. Mebby, too, they'd begin
      havin' woid from home that their wives was gettin' a little gay, or their
      kids was goin' round marryin' th' kids of their enemies, an' that one way
      an' another their domestic affairs was on th' fritz. At this, Richard'd go
      loafin' over to Philip's tent, an' say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Philly, me boy, I don't know how this crusade strikes youse, but if I'm
      any judge of these great moral movements, it's on th' blink. An' so,' he'd
      go on, 'Philly, it's me for Merrie England be th' night boat.'

    <p>
      &ldquo;Wit' that, they'd break for home; an', when they got there, they'd mebby
      hand out a taste of th' strap to mamma an' th' babies, just to teach 'em

      &ldquo;Youse don't bank much on crusades, Slimmy?&rdquo; Ike the Blood said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Blood had more than a passing interest in the movement, mention of
      which had started the discussion, being himself a part proprietor in one
      of those threatened Raines Law Hotels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood,&rdquo; observed Slimmy, oracularly, &ldquo;them moral movements is like a
      hornet; they stings onct an' then they dies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alma's attention was drawn to Mollie Squint&mdash;so called because of an
      optical slant which gave her a vague though piquant look. Mollie Squint
      was motioning from the outskirts of the little group. Alma pointed to the
      Dropper. Should she bring him? Mollie Squint shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the Dropper, Alma joined Mollie Squint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Johnny,&rdquo; gasped Mollie Squint. &ldquo;He wants you; he's over be that
      bunch of trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alma hung back; some impression of peril seized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better go,&rdquo; whispered Mollie Squint. &ldquo;He's onto you an' the Dropper, an'
      if you don't go he'll come lookin' for you. Then him an' the Dropper'll go
      to th' mat wit' each other, an' have it awful. Give Johnny one of your
      soft talks, an' mebby youse can smooth him down. Stall him off be tellin'
      him you'll see him to-night at Ding Dong's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie Squint's advice seemed good, and as the lesser of two evils Alma
      decided to go. Mollie Squint did not accompany her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell th' Dropper I'll be back in a moment,&rdquo; said Alma to Mollie Squint,
      &ldquo;an' don't wise him up about Johnny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alma met Spanish at the far corner of the clump of trees. There was no
      talk, no time for talk. They were all alone. As she drew near, he pulled a
      pistol and shot her through and through the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma's moaning cry was heard by the Dropper&mdash;that, and the sound of
      the shot. When the Dropper reached her, she was lying senseless in the
      shadow of the trees&mdash;a patch of white and red against the green of
      the grass. Spanish was nowhere in sight..
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma was carried to the hospital, and revived. But she would say nothing,
      give no names&mdash;staunch to the spirit of the Gangs. Only she whispered
      feebly to Mollie Squint, when the Dropper had been sent away by the
      doctors:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny must have loved me a lot to shoot me up like he did. A guy has got
      to love a goil good and plenty before he'll try to cook her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did youse tell th' hospital croakers his name?&rdquo; asked Mollie Squint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not! I never squealed to nobody. Do youse think I'd put poor
      Johnny in wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I won't,&rdquo; said Mollie Squint.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attendant told Mollie Squint that she must go; certain surgeons had
      begun to assemble. Mollie Squint, tears falling, kissed Alma good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give Johnny all me love,&rdquo; whispered Alma. &ldquo;Tell him I'm no snitch; I'll
      stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dropper did not have to be told whose bullet had struck down his star,
      his Alma. That night, Kid Kleiney with him, he went looking for Spanish.
      The latter, as jealous as Satan, was looking for the Dropper. Of the two,
      Spanish must have conducted his hunting with the greater circumspection or
      the greater luck; for about eleven of the clock he crept up behind the
      Dropper, as the latter and Kid Kleiney were walking in East Broadway, and
      planted a bullet in his neck. Kid Kleiney 'bout faced at the crack of the
      pistol, and was in fortunate time to stop Spanish's second bullet with one
      of the big buttons on his coat. Kid Kleiney fell by the side of the
      wounded Dropper, jarred off his feet by the shock.' He was able, however,
      when the police came up, to help place the Dropper in an ambulance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish?
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanished&mdash;as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police could get no line on him, did get no line on him, until months
      later, when, as related&mdash;the Dropper having been lagged for robbery,
      and safely caged&mdash;he came back to stick up the joint of Mersher the
      Strong-Arm, and be arrested by Dribben and Blum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby and I met casually in a Williamsburg street, where Alma had
      brought it to take the air, which was bad. Alma was thin-faced,
      hollow-eyed, but I could see that she had been pretty. She said she was
      twenty and the baby less than a year, and I think she told the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one among Alma's friends finds fault with either the baby or herself,
      although both are without defence by the canons of high morality. There is
      warmth in the world; and, after all, the case of Alma and the baby is not
      so much beyond the common, except as to the baby's advent, which was
      dramatic and after the manner of Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folk say the affair reflects illustriously upon the hospital. Also, what
      surgeons officiated are inclined to plume themselves; for have not Alma
      and the baby lived? I confess that those boastful scientists are not
      wanting in excuse for strutting, although they ought, perhaps, in honor,
      to divide credit with Alma and the baby as being hard to kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not an ugly baby as babies go. Not that I pretend to be a judge. As
      I paused by its battered perambulator, it held up a rose-leaf hand, as
      though inviting me to look; and I looked. The little claw possessed but
      three talons; the first two fingers had been shot away. When I asked how,
      Alma lowered her head sadly, saying nothing. It would have been foolish to
      ask the baby. It couldn't talk. Moreover, since the fingers were shot away
      before it was born, it could possess no clear memory as to details.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a healthy baby. Alma loves it dearly, and can be depended upon to
      give it every care. That is, she can be if she lives; and on that head her
      worn thinness alarms her friends, who wish she were fatter. Some say her
      thinness is the work of the bullet. Others believe that a sorrow is
      sapping her heart.

    <h2>
      III.&mdash;HOW PIOGGI WENT TO ELMIRA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Bottler was
      round, inoffensive, well-dressed, affable. He was also generous, as the
      East Side employs the term. Any one could touch him for a quarter upon a
      plea of beef stew, and if plaintively a bed were mentioned, for as much as
      fifty cents. For the Bottler was a money-maker, and had Suffolk Street
      position as among its richest capitalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      What bridge whist is to Fifth Avenue so is stuss to the East Side. No one
      save the dealer wins at stuss, and yet the device possesses an alluring
      feature. When the victim gets up from the table, the bank under the
      descriptive of viggresh returns him one-tenth of his losings. No one ever
      leaves a stuss game broke, and that final ray of sure sunshine forms
      indubitably the strong attraction. Stuss licks up as with a tongue of fire
      a round full fifth of all the East Side earns, and to viggresh should be
      given the black glory thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bottler owned talents to make money. Morally careless, liking the easy
      way, with, over all, that bent for speculation which sets some folk to
      dealing in stocks and others to dealing cards, those moneymaking talents
      found expression in stuss. Not that the Bottler was so weak-minded as to
      buck the game. Wise, prudent, solvent, he went the other way about it, his
      theater of operations being 135 Suffolk. Also, expanding liberally, the
      Bottler endowed his victims, as&mdash;stripped of their last dollar&mdash;they
      shoved back their hopeless chairs, with not ten, but fifteen per cent, of
      what sums they had changed in. This rendered 135 Suffolk a most popular
      resort, and the foolish stood four deep about the Bottler's tables every
      night in the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bottler lacked utterly the war-heart, and was in no wise a fighter. He
      had the brawn, but not the soul, and this heart-sallowness would have
      threatened his standing save for those easy generosities. Gangland is not
      dull, and will overlook even a want of courage in one who, for bed and
      beef stews, freely places his purse at its disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two great gangs on the East Side. These are the Five Points and
      the Monk Eastmans. There are smaller gangs, but each owes allegiance to
      either the one or the other of the two great gangs, and fights round its
      standard in event of general gang war.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is danger in belonging to either of these gangs. But there is
      greater danger in not. I speak of folk of the Bottler's ways and walks.
      The Five Points and Eastmans are at feud with one another, and the fires
      of their warfare are never permitted to die out. Membership in one means
      that it will buckler you against the other while you live, and avenge you
      should you fall. Membership in neither means that you will be raided and
      rough-housed and robbed by both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bottler's stuss house was&mdash;like every other of its kind&mdash;a
      Castle Dangerous. To the end that the peril of his days and nights be
      reduced to minimum, he united himself with the Five Points. True, he could
      not be counted upon as a <i>shtocker</i> or strong-arm; but he had money
      and would part with it, and gang war like all war demands treasure. Bonds
      must be given; fines paid; the Bottler would have his uses. Wherefore the
      Five Points opened their arms and their hearts to receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eastmans had suffered a disorganizing setback when the chief, who gave
      the sept its name, went up the river for ten years. On the heels of that
      sorrowful retirement, it became a case of York and Lancaster; two
      claimants for the throne stood forth. These were Ritchie Fitzpatrick and
      Kid Twist, both valorous, both with reputations of having killed, both
      with clouds of followers at their backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twist, in whom abode the rudiments of a savage diplomacy, proposed a
      conference. Fitzpatrick at that conference was shot to death, and Kid
      Dahl, a near friend of Twist, stood for the collar. Dahl was thus
      complacent because Fitzpatrick had not died by his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police, the gangs and the politicians are not without a sinister
      wisdom. When life has been taken, and to punish the slayer would be an
      inconvenience, some one who didn't do the killing submits to arrest. This
      covers the retreat of the guilty. Also, the public is appeased. Later,
      when the public's memory sleeps, the arrested one&mdash;for lack of
      evidence&mdash;is set at liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Fitzpatrick was killed, to clear the path to gang leadership before
      the aspiring feet of Twist, the police took Dahl, who all but volunteered
      for the sacrifice. Dahl went smilingly to jail, while the real murderer of
      Fitzpatrick attended that dead personage's wake, and later appeared at the
      funeral. This last, however, by the nicer tastes of Gangland, was
      complained of as bordering upon vulgarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitzpatrick was buried with a lily in his hand, and Twist was hailed chief
      of the Eastmans. Dahl remained in the Tombs a reasonable number of weeks,
      and then resumed his position in society. It was but natural, and to the
      glory of stumbling human nature, that Dahl should dwell warmly in the
      grateful regard of Twist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twist, now chief of the Eastmans, cast about to establish Dahl. There was
      the Bottler, with his stuss Golconda in Suffolk Street. Were not his
      affiliations with the Five Points? Was he not therefore the enemy? The
      Bottler was an Egyptian, and Twist resolved to spoil him in the interest
      of Dahl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twist, with Dahl, waited upon the Bottler. Argument was short and to the
      point. Said Twist: &ldquo;Bottler, the Kid&rdquo;&mdash;indicating the expectant Dahl&mdash;&ldquo;is
      in wit' your stuss graft from now on. It's to be an even break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The news almost checked the beating of the Bottler's heart. Not that he
      was astonished. What the puissant Twist proposed was a commonest step in
      Gangland commerce&mdash;Gangland, where the Scotch proverb of &ldquo;Take what
      you may; keep what you can!&rdquo; retains a pristine force. For all that, the
      Bottler felt dismay. The more since he had hoped that his hooking up with
      the Five Points would have kept him against such rapine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the Twist fulmination, the Bottler stood wrapped in thought. The
      dangerous chief of the Eastmans lit a cigar and waited. The poor Bottler's
      cogitations ran off in this manner. Twist had killed six men. Also, he had
      spared no pains in carrying out those homicides, and could laugh at the
      law, which his prudence left bankrupt of evidence. Dahl, too, possessed a
      past as red as Twist's. Both could be relied upon to kill. To refuse Dahl
      as a partner spelled death. To acquiesce called for half his profits. His
      friends of the Five Points, to be sure, could come at his call. That,
      however, would not save his game and might not save his life. Twist's
      demand showed that he had resolved, so far as he, the Bottler, was
      concerned, to rule or ruin. The latter was easy. Any dozen of the
      Eastmans, picking some unguarded night, could fall upon his establishment,
      confiscate his bankroll, and pitch both him and his belongings into the
      street. The Five Points couldn't be forever at his threatened elbow. They
      would avenge him, certainly; but vengeance, however sweet, comes always
      over-late, and possesses besides no value in dollars and cents. Thus
      reasoned the Bottler, while Twist frowningly paused. The finish came when,
      with a sickly smile, the Bottler bowed to the inevitable and accepted
      Dahl.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Suffolk Street, to say nothing of the thoroughfares roundabout, knew
      what had taken place. The event and the method thereof did not provoke the
      shrugging of a shoulder, the arching of a brow. What should there be in
      the usual to invite amazement?
    </p>
    <p>
      For six weeks the Bottler and Dahl settled up, fifty-and-fifty, with the
      close of each stuss day. Then came a fresh surprise. Dahl presented his
      friend, the Nailer, to the Bottler with this terse remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bottler, youse can beat it. The Nailer is goin' to be me partner now.
      Which lets you out, see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bottler was at bay. He owned no stomach for battle, but the sentiment
      of desperation, which the announcement of Dahl provoked, drove him to make
      a stand. To lose one-half had been bad. To lose all&mdash;to be wholly
      wiped out in the annals of Suffolk Street stuss&mdash;was more than even
      his meekness might bear. No, the Bottler did not dream of going to the
      police. That would have been to squeal; and even his friends of the Five
      Points had only faces of flint for such tactics of disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harassed Bottler barred his doors against Dahl. He would defend his
      castle, and get word to the Five Points. The Bottler's doors having been
      barred, Dahl for his side at once instituted a siege, despatching the
      Nailer, meanwhile, to the nearest knot of Eastmans to bring
      reinforcements.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this crisis O'Farrell of the Central Office strolled into the equation.
      He himself was hunting a loft-worker; of more than common industry, and
      had no thought of either the Bottler or Dahl. Happening, however, upon a
      situation, whereof the elemental features were Dahl outside with a gun and
      the Bottler inside with a gun, he so far recalled his oath of office as to
      interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better an egg to-day than a hen to-morrow,&rdquo; philosophized O'Farrell, and
      putting aside for the moment his search for the loft-worker, he devoted
      himself to the Bottler and Dahl.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the sure instinct of his Mulberry Street caste, O'Farrell opened
      negotiations with Dahl. He knew the latter to be the dangerous angle, and
      began by placing the muzzle of his own pistol against that marauder's
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make a move,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I'll shoot you in two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sophisticated Dahl, realizing fate, moved not, and with that the
      painstaking O'Farrell collected his armament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next the Bottler was ordered to come forth. The Bottler obeyed in a sweat
      and a tremble. He surrendered his pistol at word of the law, and O'Farrell
      led both off to jail. The two were charged with Disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the station house, and on the way, Dahl ceased not to threaten the
      Bottler's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This pinch'll cost a fine of five dollars,&rdquo; said Dahl, glaring round
      O'Farrell at the shaking Bottler. &ldquo;I'll pay it, an' then I'll get square
      wit' youse. Once we're footloose, you won't last as long as a drink of
      whiskey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge yawningly listened, while O'Farrell told his tale of that
      disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five an' costs!&rdquo; quoth the judge, and called the next case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bottler returned to Suffolk Street, Dahl sought Twist, while O'Farrell
      again took the trail of the loft-worker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dahl talked things over with Twist. There was but one way: the Bottler
      must die. Anything short 'of blood would unsettle popular respect for
      Twist, and without that his leadership of the Eastmans was a farce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bottler's killing, however, must be managed with a decent care for the
      conventionalities. For either Twist or Dahl to walk in upon that offender
      and shoot him to death, while feasible, would be foolish. The coarse
      extravagance of such a piece of work would serve only to pile needless
      difficulties in the pathway of what politicians must come to the rescue.
      It was impertinences of that character which had sent Monk Eastman to Sing
      Sing. Eastman had so far failed as to the proprieties, when as a
      supplement to highway robbery he emptied his six-shooter up and down
      Forty-second Street, that the politicians could not save him without
      burning their fingers. And so they let him go. Twist had justified the
      course of the politicians upon that occasion. He would not now, by lack of
      caution and a reasonable finesse, force them into similar peril. They must
      and would defend him; but it was not for him to render their labors too
      up-hill and too hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twist sent to Williamsburg for his friend and ally, Cyclone Louie. The
      latter was a bull-necked, highly muscled individual, who was a
      professional strong man&mdash;so far as he was professionally anything&mdash;and
      earned occasional side-show money at Coney Island by bending iron bars
      about his neck and twisting pokers into corkscrews about his brawny arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louie, Twist and Dahl went into council over mutual beer, and Twist
      explained the imperative call for the Bottler's extermination. Also, he
      laid bare the delicate position of both himself and Dahl.
    </p>
    <p>
      In country regions neighbors aid one another in bearing the burdens of an
      agricultural day by changing work. The custom is not without what one
      might call gang imitation and respect. Only in the gang instance the work
      is not innocent, but bloody. Louie, having an appreciation of what was due
      a friend, could not do less than come to the relief of Twist and Dahl.
      Were positions reversed, would they not journey to Williamsburg and do as
      much for him? Louie did not hesitate, but placed himself at the disposal
      of Twist and Dahl. The Bottler should die; he, Louie, would see to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twist, replying, felt that the thing should be done at once, and mentioned
      the following evening, nine o'clock. The place should be the Bottler's
      establishment in Suffolk Street. Louie, of whom the Bottler was unafraid
      and ignorant, should experience no difficulty in approaching his man.
      There would be others present; but, practiced in gang moralities, slaves
      to gang etiquette, no one would open his mouth. Or, if he did, it would be
      only to pour forth perjuries, and say that he had seen nothing, heard
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having adjusted details, Louie, Twist and Dahl compared watches. Watches?
      Certainly. Louie, Twist and Dahl were all most fashionably attired and&mdash;as
      became members of a gang nobility&mdash;singularly full and accurate in
      the important element of a front, <i>videlicet</i>, that list of personal
      adornments which included scarf pin, ring and watch. Louie, Dahl and Twist
      saw to it that their timepieces agreed. This was so that Dahl and Twist
      might arrange their alibis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the next evening. At 8.55 o'clock Twist was obtrusively in the
      Delancey Street police station, wrangling with the desk sergeant over the
      release of a follower who had carefully brought about his own arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; urged Twist to the sergeant, &ldquo;it's next to nine o'clock now. Fix
      up the bond; I've got a date over in East Broadway at nine-thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Twist stood thus enforcing his whereabouts and the hour upon the
      attention of the desk sergeant, Dahl was eating a beefsteak in a Houston
      street restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time have youse got?&rdquo; demanded Dahl of the German who kept the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five minutes to nine,&rdquo; returned the German, glancing up at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, t'aint no such time as that,&rdquo; retorted Dahl peevishly. &ldquo;That clock's
      drunk! Call up the telephone people, and find out for sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 'phone people say it's nine o'clock,&rdquo; reported the German, hanging up
      the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hully gee! I didn't think it was more'n halfpast eight!&rdquo; and Dahl looked
      virtuously corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these fragments of talk were taking place, the Bottler was attending
      to his stuss interests. He looked pale and frightened, and his hunted eyes
      roved here and there. Five minutes went by. The clock pointed to nine. A
      slouch-hat stranger entered. As the clock struck the hour, he placed the
      muzzle of a pistol against the Bottler's breast, and fired twice. Both
      bullets pierced the heart, and the Bottler fell&mdash;dead without a word.
      There were twenty people in the room. When the police arrived they found
      only the dead Bottler.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Farrell recalled those trade differences which had culminated in the
      charge of disturbance, and arrested Dahl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't got me right,&rdquo; scoffed Dahl.
    </p>
    <p>
      And O'Farrell hadn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came the inquest, and Dahl was set free. The Bottler was buried, and
      Twist and Dahl sent flowers and rode to the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law slept, a bat-eyed constabulary went its way, but the gangs knew.
      In the whispered gossip of Gangland every step of the Bottler's murder was
      talked over and remembered. He must have been minus ears and eyes and
      understanding who did not know the story. The glance of Gangland turned
      towards the Five Points. What would be their action? They were bound to
      avenge. If not for the Bottler's sake, then for their own. For the Bottler
      had been under the shadow of their protection, and gang honor was
      involved. On the Five Points' part there was no stumbling of the spirit.
      For the death of the Bottler the Five Points would exact the penalty of
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distinguished among the chivalry of the Five Points was Kid Pioggi. Only a
      paucity of years&mdash;he was under eighteen&mdash;withheld Pioggi from
      topmost honors. Pioggi was not specifically assigned to avenge the
      departed Bottler. Ambitious and gallantly anxious of advancement, however,
      he of his own motion carried the enterprise in the stomach of his
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter's snow melted into spring, spring lapsed into early summer. It
      was a brilliant evening, and Pioggi was disporting himself at Coney
      Island. Also Twist and Cyclone Louie, following some plan of relaxation,
      were themselves at Coney Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pioggi had seated himself at a beer table in Ding Dong's. Twist and Louie
      came in. Pioggi, being of the Five Points, was recognized as a foe by
      Twisty who lost no time in mentioning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in a facetious mood, and by way of expressing his contempt for that
      gentleman, Twist made Pioggi jump out of the window. It was no distance to
      the ground, and no physical harm could come. But to be compelled to leave
      Ding Dong's by way of the window, rubbed wrongwise the fur of Pioggi's
      feelings. To jump from a window stamps one with disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twist and Louie&mdash;burly, muscular, strong as horses&mdash;were adepts
      of rough-and-tumble. Pioggi, little, light and weak, knew that any thought
      of physical conflict would have been preposterous. And yet he was no one
      to sit quietly down with his humiliation. That flight from Ding Dong's
      window would be on every tongue in Gangland. The name of Pioggi would
      become a scorning; the tale would stain the Pioggi fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louie and Twist sat down at the table in Ding Dong's, from which Pioggi
      had been driven, and demanded refreshment in the guise of wine. Pioggi,
      rage-swollen as to heart, busied himself at a nearby telephone. Pioggi got
      the ear of a Higher Influence of his clan. He told of his abrupt dismissal
      from Ding Dong's, and the then presence of Louie and Twist. The Higher
      Influence instructed Pioggi to keep the two in sight. The very flower of
      the Five Points should be at Coney Island as fast as trolley cars could
      carry them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tail 'em,&rdquo; said the Higher Influence, referring to Twist and Louie; &ldquo;an'
      when the fleet gets there go in wit' your cannisters an' bump 'em off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While waiting the advent of his promised forces, Pioggi, maintaining the
      while an eye on Twist and Louie to the end that they escape not and
      disappear, made arrangements for a getaway. He established a coupé, a fast
      horse between the shafts and a personal friend on the box, where he,
      Pioggi, could find it when his work was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time this was accomplished, Pioggi's recruits had put in an
      appearance. They did not descend upon Coney Island in a body, with savage
      uproar and loud cries. Much too military were they for that. Rather they
      seemed to ooze into position around Pioggi, and they could not have made
      less noise had they been so many ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign was soon laid out. Louie and Twist still sat over their wine
      at Ding Dong's. Now and then they laughed, as though recalling the
      ignominious exit of Pioggi. Means must be employed to draw them into the
      street. That accomplished, the Five Points' Danites were to drift up
      behind them, and at a signal from Pioggi, empty their pistols into their
      backs. Pioggi would fire a bullet into Twist; that was to be the signal.
      As Pioggi whispered his instructions, there shone a licking eagerness in
      the faces of those who listened. Nothing so exalts the gangster like blood
      in anticipation; nothing so pleases him as to shoot from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pioggi pitched upon one whose name and face were unknown to Twist and
      Louie. The unknown would be the bearer of a blind message&mdash;it
      purported to come from a dancer in one of the cheap theaters of the place&mdash;calculated
      to bring forth Twist and Louie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stall 'em up this way,&rdquo; said Pioggi, indicating a spot within touching
      distance of that coupé. &ldquo;It's here we'll put 'em over the jump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The place pitched upon for the killing was crowded with people. It was
      this very thronged condition which had led to its selection. The crowd
      would serve as a cover to Five Points operations. It would prevent a
      premature recognition of their assailants by Twist and Louie; it would
      screen the slayers from identification by casual citizens looking on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pioggi's messenger did well his work, and Twist and Louie moved
      magnificently albeit unsteadily into the open. They were sweeping the walk
      clear of lesser mortals, when the voice of Pioggi arrested their
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there, Twist; look here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice came from the rear and to the right; Pioggi's position was one
      calculated to place the enemy at a double disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twist turned his head. A bullet struck him above the eye! He staggered!
      The lead came in a storm! Twist went down; Louie fell across him! There
      were twelve bullets in Twist and eight in Louie. The coroner said that
      they were the deadest people of whom he owned official recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the forethoughtful Pioggi was dashing away in his coupé, a policeman
      gave chase. Pioggi drove a bullet through the helmet of the law. It
      stopped pursuit; but Gangland has ever held that the shot was an error. A
      little lower, and the policeman would have been killed. Also, the death of
      a policeman is apt to entail consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pioggi went into hiding in Greenwich, where the Five Points had a
      hold-out. There were pullings and haulings and whisperings in dark
      political corners. When conditions had been whispered and hauled and
      pulled into shape satisfactory, Pioggi sent word to a favorite officer to
      come and arrest him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pioggi explained to the court that his life had been threatened; he had
      shot only that he himself might live. His age was seventeen. Likewise
      there had been no public loss; the going of Twist and Louie had but raised
      the average of all respectability. The court pondered the business, and
      decided that justice would be fulfilled by sentencing Pioggi to the Elmira
      Reformatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best fashion of the Five Points visited Pioggi in the Tombs on the
      morning of his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only thirteen months, Kid,&rdquo; came encouragingly from one. &ldquo;You won't
      mind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind it!&rdquo; responded Pioggi, in disdain of the worst that Elmira might
      hold for him; &ldquo;mind it! I could do it standin' on me head.&rdquo;
     </p>

      IV.&mdash;IKE THE BLOOD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>henever the police
      were driven to deal with him officially, he called himself Charles Livin,
      albeit the opinion prevailed at headquarters that in thus spelling it, he
      left off a final ski. The police, in the wantonness of their ignorance,
      described him on their books as a burglar. This was foolishly wide. He
      should have been listed as a simple Strong-Arm, whose methods of divorcing
      other people from their money, while effective, were coarse. Also, it is
      perhaps proper to mention that his gallery number at the Central Office
      was 10,394.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the supremacy of Monk Eastman that he broke out, and he had
      just passed his seventeenth birthday. Being out, he at once attached
      himself to the gang-fortunes of that chief; and it became no more than a
      question of weeks before his vast physical strength, the energy of his
      courage and a native ferocity of soul, won him his proud war-name of Ike
      the Blood. Compared with the herd about him, in what stark elements made
      the gangster important in his world, he shone out upon the eyes of folk
      like stars of a clear cold night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ike the Blood looked up to his chief, Monk Eastman, as sailors look up to
      the North Star, and it wrung his soul sorely when that gang captain went
      to Sing Sing. In the war over the succession and the baton of gang
      command, waged between Ritchie Fitzpatrick and Kid Twist, Ike the Blood
      was compelled to stand neutral. Powerless to take either side, liking both
      ambitious ones, the trusted friend of both, his hands were tied; and later&mdash;first
      Fitzpatrick and then Twist&mdash;he followed both to the grave, sorrow not
      only on his lips but in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one recent August day that I was granted an introduction to Ike the
      Blood. I was in the company of an intimate friend of mine&mdash;he holds
      high Central Office position in the police economy of New York. We were
      walking in Henry Street, in the near vicinity of that vigorous
      organization, the Ajax Club&mdash;so called, I take it, because its
      members are forever defying the lightnings of the law. My Central Office
      friend had mentioned Ike the Blood, speaking of him as a guiding light to
      such difficult ones as Little Karl, Whitey Louie, Benny Weiss, Kid
      Neumann, Tomahawk, Fritzie Rice, Dagley and the Lobster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as the names were in his mouth, his keen Central Office glance went
      roving through the open doorway of a grogshop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Ike the Blood now,&rdquo; said he, and tossed a thumb, which had
      assisted in necking many a malefactor with tastes to be violent, towards
      the grogshop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since to consider such pillars of East Side Society was the great reason
      of my ramble, we entered the place. Ike the Blood was sitting in state at
      a table to the rear of the unclean bar, a dozen of his immediate followers&mdash;in
      the politics of gang life these formed a minor order of nobility&mdash;with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being addressed by my friend, he arose and joined us; none the less he
      seemed reticent and a bit disturbed. This was due to the official
      character of my friend, plus the fact that the jealous eyes of those
      others were upon him. It is no advantage to a leader, like Ike the Blood,
      to be seen in converse with a detective. Should one of his adherents be
      arrested within a day or a week, the arrested one reverts to that
      conversation, and imagines vain things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a walk with us, Ike,&rdquo; said my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ike the Blood was obviously reluctant. Sinking his voice, and giving a
      glance over his shoulder at his myrmidons&mdash;not ten feet away, and
      every eye upon him&mdash;he remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, I don't want to leave th' push settin' here, to go chasin' off wit'
      a bull. Fix it so I can come uptown sometime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned my friend, relenting; &ldquo;I don't want to put you in
      Dutch with your fleet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a whispered brief word or two, and an arrangement for a meet was
      made; after which Ike the Blood lapsed into the uneasy circle he had
      quitted. As we left the grogshop, we could hear him loudly calling for
      beer. Possibly the Central Office nearness of my friend had rendered him
      thirsty. Or it may have been that the beer was meant to wet down and allay
      whatever of sprouting suspicion had been engendered in the trustless
      breasts of his followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a week later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day, dark and showery, was&mdash;to be exact&mdash;the eighth of
      August. Faithful to that whispered Henry Street arrangement, Ike the Blood
      sat awaiting the coming of my friend and myself in the Bal Tabarin. He had
      spoken of the stuss house of Phil Casey and Paper Box Johnny, in
      Twenty-ninth Street, but my friend entered a protest. There was his
      Central Office character to be remembered. A natural embarrassment must
      ensue were he brought face to face with stuss in a state of activity.
      Stuss was a crime, by surest word of law, and he had taken an oath of
      office. He did not care to pinch either Paper Box or Casey, and therefore
      preferred not to be drawn into a situation where the only alternative
      would be to either pull their joint or lay the bedplates of complaint
      against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no good time to be up on charges,&rdquo; remonstrated my friend, &ldquo;for the
      commish that's over us now would sooner grab a copper than a crook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus instructed, and feeling the delicacy of my friend's position, Ike the
      Blood had shifted suggestion to the Bal Tabarin. The latter house of
      entertainment, in Twenty-eighth Street, was innocent of stuss and indeed
      cards in any form. Kept by Sam Paul, it possessed a deserved popularity
      with Ike and the more select of his acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ike the Blood appeared to better advantage in the Bal Tabarin than on that
      other, Henry Street, grogshop occasion. Those suspicious ones, of lowering
      eye and doubtful brow, had been left behind, and their absence contributed
      to his relief, and therefore to his looks. Not that he had been sitting in
      the midst of loneliness at the Bal Tabarin; Whitey Dutch and Slimmy were
      with him, and who should have been better company than they? Also, their
      presence was of itself an honor, since they were of his own high caste,
      and many layers above a mere gang peasantry. They would take part in the
      conversation, too, and, if to talk and touch glasses with a Central Office
      bull were an offense, it would leave them as deep in the police mud as was
      he in the police mire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ike the Blood received us gracefully, if not enthusiastically, and was so
      polite as to put me on a friendly footing with his companions. Greetings
      over, and settled to something like our ease, I engaged myself mentally in
      taking Ike's picture. His forehead narrow, back-sloping at that lively
      angle identified by carpenters as a quarter-pitch, was not the forehead of
      a philosopher. I got the impression, too, that his small brown eyes, sad
      rather than malignant, would in any heat of anger blaze like twin balls of
      brown fire. Cheek-bones high; nose beaky, predatory&mdash;such a nose as
      Napoleon loved in his marshals; mouth coarsely sensitive, suggesting
      temperament; the broad, bony jaw giving promise of what staying qualities
      constitute the stock in trade of a bulldog; no mustache, no beard; a
      careless liberality of ear&mdash;that should complete the portrait. Fairly
      given, it was the picture of one who acted more than he thought, and whose
      atmosphere above all else conveyed the feeling of relentless force&mdash;the
      picture of one who under different circumstances might have been a Murat
      or a Massena.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend managed the conversation, and did it with Central Office tact.
      Knowing what I was after, he brought up Gangland and the gangs, upon which
      topics Whitey Dutch, seeing no reasons for silence, spoke instructively.
      Aside from the great gangs, the Eastmans and the Five Points, I learned
      that other smaller yet independent gangs existed. Also, from Whitey's
      discourse, it was made clear that just as countries had frontiers, so also
      were there frontiers to the countries of the gangs. The Five Points, with
      fifteen hundred on its puissant muster rolls, was supreme&mdash;he said&mdash;between
      Broadway and the Bowery, Fourteenth Street and City Hall Park. The
      Eastmans, with one thousand warriors, flourished between Monroe and
      Fourteenth Streets, the Bowery and the East River. The Gas House Gang,
      with only two hundred in its nose count, was at home along Third Avenue
      between Eleventh and Eighteenth Streets. The vivacious Gophers were
      altogether heroes of the West Side. They numbered full five hundred, each
      a holy terror, and ranged the region bounded by Seventh Avenue, Fourteenth
      Street, Tenth Avenue and Forty-second Street. The Gophers owned a
      rock-bottom fame for their fighting qualities, and, speaking in the sense
      militant, neither the Eastmans nor the Five Points would care to mingle
      with them on slighter terms than two to one. The fulness of Whitey Dutch,
      himself of the Five Points, in what justice he did the Gophers, marked his
      splendid breadth of soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ike the Blood, overhung by some cloud of moodiness, devoted himself
      moderately to beer, taking little or less part in the talk. Evidently
      there was something bearing him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't feelin' gay,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;an' at that, if youse was to ast me,
      I couldn't tell youse why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As though a thought had been suggested, he arose and started for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't be away ten minutes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slimmy looked curiously at Whitey Dutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's chased off to one of them fortune-tellers,&rdquo; said Whitey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do youse take any stock in them ginks who claims they can skin a deck of
      cards, or cock their eye into a teacup, an' then put you next to
      everyt'ing that'll happen to you in a year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slimmy aimed this at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon my assurance, given with emphasis, that I attached no weight to
      so-called seers and fortunetellers, he was so magnanimous as to indorse my
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're a bunch of cheap bunks,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I've gone ag'inst 'em time
      an' time, an' there's nothin' in it. One of 'em gives me his woid&mdash;after
      me comin' across wit' fifty cents&mdash;th' time Belfast Danny's in
      trouble, that Danny'll be toined out all right. Two days later Danny gets
      settled for five years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ike's stuck on 'em,&rdquo; remarked Whitey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slimmy and Whitey Dutch, speaking freely and I think veraciously, told me
      many things. Whitey explained that, while he and Slimmy were shining
      lights of the Five Points, yet to be found fraternizing with Ike the Blood&mdash;an
      Eastman&mdash;was in perfect keeping with gang proprieties. For, as he
      pointed out, there was momentary truce between the Eastmans and the Five
      Points. Among the gangs, in seasons of gang peace, the nobles&mdash;by
      word of Whitey&mdash;were expected to make stately calls of ceremony and
      good fellowship upon one another, as had been the wont among Highland
      chieftains in the days of Bruce and Wallace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of the Gas House Gang: how do they live?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stickin' up lushes mostly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much of this stick-up work goes on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;thoughtfully&mdash;&ldquo;they'll pull off as many as twenty-five
      stick-ups to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no such number of squeals coming in at headquarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The contradiction emanated from my Central Office friend, who felt
      criticized by inference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squeals!&rdquo; exclaimed Whitey Dutch with warmth, &ldquo;w'y should they squeal?
      The Gas House push'd cook 'em if they squealed. Suppose right now I was to
      go out an' get put in th' air; do you think I'd squeal? Well, I should say
      not; I'm no mutt! They'd about come gallopin' 'round tomorry wit'
      bale-sticks, an' break me arms an' legs, or mebby knock me block off. W'y,
      not a week ago, three Gas House <i>shtockers</i> stands me up in
      Riving-ton Street, an' takes me clock&mdash;a red one wit' two doors. Then
      they pinches a fiver out of me keck. They even takes me bank-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at license has a stiff like youse got to have $375 in th' bank?' they
      says&mdash;like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next night they comes bluffin' round for me three hundred and
      seventy-five dollar plant&mdash;w'at do you t'ink of that? But I'm there
      wit' a gatt me-self that time, an' ready to give 'em an argument. W'en
      they sees I'm framed up, they gets cold feet. But you can bet I don't do
      no squealin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get back your watch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I get it back?&rdquo; peevishly. &ldquo;No, I don't get back me watch. All
      the same, I'll lay for them babies. Some day I'll get 'em right, an' trim
      'em to the queen's taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend, leading conversation in his specious Central Office way, spoke
      of Ike the Blood's iron fame, and slanted talk in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ike can certainly go some!&rdquo; observed Slimmy meditatively. &ldquo;Take it from
      me, there ain't any of 'em, even th' toughest ever, wants his game.&rdquo;
       Turning to Whitey: &ldquo;Don't youse remember, Whitey, when he tears into
      Humpty Jackson an' two of his mob, over in Thirteenth Street, that time?
      There's nothin' to it! Ike simply makes 'em jump t'rough a hoop! Every
      lobster of 'em has his rod wit' him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn't have had the nerve to fire 'em if they'd pulled 'em,&rdquo;
       sneered Whitey. &ldquo;Ike'd have made 'em eat th' guttaperchy all off th'
      handles, too. Say, I don't t'ink much of that Gas House fleet. They talk
      strong; but they don't bring home th' goods, see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that, in spite of his sanguinary title, Ike the Blood had
      never killed his man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's tried,&rdquo; explained Slimmy, who felt as though the absent one, in his
      blood-guiltlessness, required defense; &ldquo;but he all th' time misses. Ike's
      th' woist shot wit' a rod in th' woild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Mike!&rdquo;&mdash;from Whitey Dutch, his nose in his drink; &ldquo;he couldn't
      hit th' Singer Buildin'.&rdquo; '&ldquo;How does he make his money?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loft worker,&rdquo; broke in my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark was calculated to explode the others into fresh confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't youse believe it!&rdquo; came in vigorous denial from Whitey Dutch. &ldquo;Ike
      never cracked a bin in his life. You bulls&rdquo;&mdash;this was pointed
      especially at my friend&mdash;&ldquo;say he's a dip, too. W'y, it's a laugh! Ike
      couldn't pick th' pocket of a dead man&mdash;couldn't put his hand into a
      swimmin' tank! That's how fly he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't try to string me,&rdquo; retorted my friend, severely. &ldquo;Didn't Ike
      fill in with Little Maxie and his mob, when they worked the Jersey fairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that was only to do the strong-arm work, in case there's a scrap,&rdquo;
       protested Whitey. &ldquo;On th' level, Ike is woise than Big Abrams. He can't
      even stall. An' as for gettin' a leather or a watch, gettin' a perfecto
      out of a cigar box would be about his limit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Joisey's a bum place; youse can go there for t'ree cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last was interjected by Slimmy&mdash;who had a fine wit of his own&mdash;with
      the hopeful notion of diverting discussion to less exciting questions than
      pocket-picking at the New Jersey fairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It developed that while Ike the Blood had now and then held up a stuss
      game for its bank-roll, during some desperate ebb-tide of his fortunes, he
      drew his big income from a yearly ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gives a racket,&rdquo; declared Whitey Dutch; &ldquo;that's how Ike gets his
      dough. Th' last one he pulls off nets him about twenty-five hundred
      plunks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What price were the tickets?&rdquo; I inquired. Twenty-five hundred dollars
      sounded large.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' tickets is fifty cents,&rdquo; returned Whitey, &ldquo;but that's got nothin' to
      do wit' it. A guy t'rows down say a ten-spot at th' box-office, like that&rdquo;&mdash;and
      Whitey made a motion with his hand, which was royal in its generous
      openness. &ldquo;'Gimme a pasteboard!' he says; an' that ends it; he ain't
      lookin' for no change back. Every sport does th' same. Some t'rows in
      five, some ten, some guy even changes in a twenty if he's pulled off a
      trick an' is feelin' flush. It's all right; there's nothin' in bein' a
      piker. Ike himself sells th' tickets; an' th' more you planks down th'
      more he knows you like him.&rdquo; It was becoming plain. A gentleman of gang
      prominence gives a ball&mdash;a racket&mdash;and coins, so to speak, his
      disrepute. He of sternest and most bloody past takes in the most money. To
      discover one's status in Gangland, one has but to give a racket.. The
      measure of the box-receipts will be the dread measure of one's reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One t'ing youse can say of Ike,&rdquo; observed Slimmy, wearing the while a
      look of virtue, &ldquo;he never made no money off a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never in all his life took a dollar off a doll!&rdquo; added Whitey,
      corroboratively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ike the Blood reappearing at this juncture, it was deemed best to cease&mdash;audibly,
      at least&mdash;all consideration of his merits. He might have regarded
      discussion, so personal to himself, with disfavor. Laughing lightly, he
      took his old place at the table, and beckoned the waiter. Compared with
      what had been its former cloudy expression, his face wore a look of
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, I don't mind tellin' youse guys,&rdquo; he said at last, breaking into an
      uneasy laugh, &ldquo;but th' fact is, I skinned round into Sixt' Avenoo to a
      fortune teller&mdash;a dandy, she is&mdash;one that t'rows a fit, or goes
      into a trance, or some such t'ing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fortune teller!&rdquo; said Slimmy, as though he'd never heard the word
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's on account of a dream. In all th' years&rdquo;&mdash;Ike spoke as might
      one who had put a century behind him&mdash;&ldquo;in all th' years I've been
      knockin' about, an' I've had me troubles, I never gets a notch on me gun,
      see? Not that I went lookin' for any; not that I'm lookin' for any now.
      But last night I had a dream:&mdash;I dreams I croaks a guy. Mebby it's
      somet'in' I'd been eatin'; mebby it's because of me havin' a pretty hot
      argument th' mornin' before; but anyhow it bothers me&mdash;that dream
      does. You see&rdquo;&mdash;this to my friend&mdash;&ldquo;I'm figgerin' on openin' a
      house over in Twenty-fift' Street, an' these West Side ducks is all for
      givin' me th' frozen face. They say I oughter stick down on th' East Side,
      where I belongs, an' not come chasin' up here, cuttin' in on their graft.
      Anyhow, I dreams I puts th' foist notch on me gun&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you consult a fortune teller,&rdquo; laughed my friend, who was not
      superstitious, but practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I tells you. As I says, I blows in on that trance party. I
      don't wise her up about any dream, but comes t'rough wit' th' little old
      one buck she charges, an' says: 'There you be! Now roll your game for th'
      limit!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which she proceeded to do,&rdquo; broke in my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! Th' old dame&mdash;after coppin' me dollar&mdash;stiffens back
      an' shuts her eyes; an' next, th' foist flash out of th' box she says&mdash;speakin'
      like th' wind in a keyhole: 'You're in th' midst of trouble; a man is
      killed!' Then she wakes up. 'W'y didn't youse go t'rough?' I says; T want
      th' rest. Who is it gets croaked, th' other dub or me?' Th' old dame
      insists that to go back, an' get th' address of th' party who's been
      bumped off, she must have another dollar. Oh, they're th' birds, them
      fortune tellers, to grab th' dough! But of course I can't stop there, so I
      bucks up wit' another bone. 'There you be,' I says; 'now, is it me that
      gets it, or does he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at he?&rdquo; demanded Whitey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; The tone and manner were impatient. &ldquo;It's th' geek I'm
      havin' trouble wit'.&rdquo; Ike looked at me, as one who would understand and
      perhaps sympathize, and continued: &ldquo;This time th' old dame says th' party
      who's been cooked is some other guy; it ain't me. T can see now that it
      ain't you,' she says. 'You're ridin' away in a patrol wagon, wit' a lot of
      harness bulls.' That's good so far. 'So I gets th' collar?' I says. 'How
      about th' trial?' She answers, 'There ain't no trial;' an' then she comes
      out of her trance, same as a diver comes up out o' the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Slimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where she lets me off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'y don't youse dig for another dollar,&rdquo; said Whitey, &ldquo;an' tell th' old
      hag to put on her suit an' go down ag'in for th' rest?&rdquo; Whitey had been
      impressed by that simile of the diver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at more is there to get? I ain't killed; an' I ain't tried&mdash;that
      oughter do me. Th' coroner t'rows me loose, most likely. Anyhow, I ain't
      goin' to sit there all day, skinnin' me roll for that old sponge&mdash;a
      plunk a crack, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk of th' cost of livin'!&rdquo; remarked Slimmy, with a grin. &ldquo;Ain't it
      fierce, th' way them fortune tellers'll slim a guy's bank-roll for him,
      once they has him hooked? They'll get youse to goin'; an' after that it's
      like one of them stories w'at ends wit' 'Continued in our next.' W'y, it's
      like playin' th' horses, only woise. Th' foist day you goes out to win;
      an' after that, you keep goin' back to get even.&rdquo; Ike the Blood paid no
      heed to the pessimistic philosophy of Slimmy; he was too wholly wrapped up
      in what he had been told.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he broke forth, following a ruminative pause, &ldquo;anyhow, I'd sooner
      he gets it than me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go ag'in about that 'he,'&rdquo; protested Whitey, and the manner of
      Whitey was querulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' guy she sees me hooked up wit'!&rdquo; This came off a bit warmly. &ldquo;You
      know w'at I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it easy!&mdash;take it easy!&rdquo; urged my friend. &ldquo;What is there to get
      hot about? You don't mean to say, Ike, you're banking on that guff the old
      dame handed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next week&rdquo;&mdash;the shadow of a smile playing across his face&mdash;&ldquo;I
      won't believe it. But it sounds like th' real t'ing now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of the Bal Tabarin opened to the advent of a weasel-eyed
      individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Whitey!&rdquo; exclaimed Weasel-eye cheerily, shaking hands with Whitey
      Dutch. &ldquo;I just leaves a namesake of yours; an' say, he's in bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at namesake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whitey Louie. A bunch of them West Side guerrillas has him cornered, over
      in a dump at Twenty-seventh Street and Seventh Avenoo. It looks like
      there'd be somethin' doin'; an', as I don't Avant no part of it, I screws
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the name of Whitey Louie, Ike the Blood arose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whitey Louie?&rdquo; he questioned; &ldquo;Seventh Avenoo an' Twenty-seventh Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's th' ticket,&rdquo; replied Weasel-eye; &ldquo;an' youse can cash on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ike the Blood hurried out the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whitey Louie is Ike's closest pal,&rdquo; observed Whitey Dutch, explaining the
      hurried departure. &ldquo;Will there be trouble?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't t'ink so,&rdquo; said Slimmy. &ldquo;It's four for one they'll lay down to
      Ike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't put your swell bet on it!&rdquo; came warningly from Whitey Dutch; &ldquo;them
      Gophers are as tough a bunch as ever comes down the pike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tough nothin'!&rdquo; returned Slimmy: &ldquo;they'll be duck soup to Ike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you look into it?&rdquo; I asked, turning to my friend. As a
      taxpayer, I yearned for some return on that $16,000,000 a year which New
      York City pays for its police.
    </p>
    <p>
      That ornament of the Central Office yawned, and motioned to the waiter to
      bring his bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sort of thing is up to the cop on the beat,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whitey an' me 'ud get in on it,&rdquo; explained Slimmy&mdash;his expression
      was one of half apology&mdash;&ldquo;only you see we belong at th' other end of
      th' alley. We're Five Points; Ike an' Whitey Louie are Eastmans; an' in a
      clash between Eastmans an' Gophers, it's up to us to stand paws-off, see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's straight talk,&rdquo; coincided Whitey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose, seeing it's stopped raining, we drift over there,&rdquo; said my
      friend, adjusting his Panama at the exact Central Office angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we journeyed along, I noticed Slimmy and Whitey Dutch across the
      street. It was already written that Whitey Dutch, himself, would be shot
      to death in the Stag before the year was out; but the shadow of that
      impending taking-off was not apparent in his face. Indeed, from that face
      there shone forth only pleasure in anticipation, and a lively interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'd no more miss it than they'd miss a play at the theater,&rdquo; remarked
      my friend, who saw where my glance was directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a ginmill, on the corner of Seventh Avenue and Twenty-seventh
      Street, a crowd had collected. A patrol wagon was backing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      An officer in uniform tossed a prisoner into the wagon, with no more
      ceremony than should attend the handling of a bag of bran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Dubillier!&rdquo; exclaimed Whitey Dutch, naming the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Five Pointers had taken position on the edge of the crowd,
      directly in front of my friend and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Ike!&rdquo; said Slimmy, as two policemen were seen pushing their way
      towards the patrol wagon, Ike the Blood between them. &ldquo;Them bulls is
      holdin' him up, too, an' his face is as pale as paper! By thunder, they've
      nailed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you them Gophers were tough students,&rdquo; was the comment of Whitey
      Dutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend began forcing his way forward. As he plowed through the crowd,
      Whitey Dutch and Slimmy, having advantage of his wake, kept close at his
      heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slimmy threw me a whispered word: &ldquo;Be th' way th' mob is actin', I t'ink
      Ike copped one.&rdquo; Slimmy, before the lapse of many minutes, was again at my
      side, attended by Whitey Dutch. The pair wore that manner of quick yet
      neutral appreciation which belongs&mdash;we'll say&mdash;with such as
      English army officers visiting the battlefield of Santiago while the
      action between the Spaniards and the Americans is being waged. It wasn't
      their fight, it was an Eastman-Gopher fight, but as fullblown Five
      Pointers it became them vastly to be present. Also, they might learn
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ike dropped one,&rdquo; nodded Whitey Dutch, answering the question in my eye.
      &ldquo;It's Ledwich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the row about?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whitey Louie. The Gophers was goin' to hand it to him; but just then Ike
      comes through th' door on th' run, an' wit' that they outs wit' their rods
      an' goes to peggin' at him. Then Ike gets to goin' an' cops Ledwich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' best th' Gophers can get,&rdquo; observed Slimmy&mdash;and his manner was
      as the manner of one balancing an account&mdash;&ldquo;th' best th' Gophers can
      get is an even break; an' to do that they'll have to cash on Ike. Whitey
      Louie? He makes his get-away all right. Say, Whitey, let's beat it round
      to the Tenderloin Station, an' get th' finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The finish was soon told. Ike the Blood lay dead on the station house
      floor; a bullet had drilled its dull way through his lungs. An officer was
      just telephoning his people in Chrystie Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now do youse see?&rdquo; said Whitey Dutch, correcting what he conceived to be
      Slimmy's skepticism; &ldquo;that fortune tellin' skirt handed out th' right
      dope. 'One croaked!&mdash;Ike in th' hurry-up wagon!&mdash;no trial!'
      That's th' spiel she makes; an' it falls true, see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ike oughter have dug down for another bone,&rdquo; returned Slimmy, more than
      half convinced; &ldquo;she'd have put him hep to that bullet in his breather,
      mebby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at good 'ud that have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good? If he'd got th' tip, he might have ducked&mdash;you can't tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a bad business,&rdquo; I commented to my friend, who had rejoined me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a good thing&rdquo;&mdash;shrugging his cynical Central Office
      shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;if, with a change of names, it could happen every day in
      the year. By the way, I forgot my umbrella; let's go back to the Bal
      Tabarin.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      V.&mdash;INDIAN LOUIE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>o one knew his
      real name, not even the police, and the police, let me tell you, know much
      more than they can prove. The Central Office never once had the pleasure
      of mugging and measuring and parading him at the morning bawling out, and
      the Mulberry Street records to the last were barren concerning him. For
      one brief space and only one did Mulberry Street nourish hopes. That was
      when he himself let it be thought that somewhere, sometime, somehow, he
      had taken some one's life. At this, Mulberry Street fairly shook the wide
      earth like a tablecloth in search of proof, but got not so much as one
      poor crumb of confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at Big Jack's in Chatham Square that local history first laid eyes
      on him. Big Jack is gone now; the Committee of Fourteen decided upon him
      virtuously as an immoralist, handed him the fatal blue paper, and he
      perished. Jack Sirocco&mdash;who was himself blue-papered in a Park Row
      hour&mdash;keeps the place now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting from Big Jack's, he soon began to be known in Flynn's, and Nigger
      Mike's, and about the Chatham Club. When his pals spoke to him they called
      him Louie. When they spoke of him they called him Indian Louie, or Spanish
      Louie, to the end that he be identified among the hosts of East Side
      Louies, who were and are as many as the leaves on a large tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumor made Indian Louie a native of South America, and his dark skin,
      black eyes, thin lips, high cheek-bones and high curved nose helped rumor
      out in this. Also, he was supposed to be of Spanish or Portuguese
      extraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Louie was buried, this latter assumption received a jolt. His
      funeral, conducted by a rabbi, was according to strictest Hebrew
      ceremonial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two pieces of porcelain were laid upon his eyes, as intimating that he had
      seen enough. A feather, which a breath would have disturbed, was placed
      upon his upper lip. This was to evidence him as fully and conclusively
      dead, although on that point, in all conscience, the coroner's finding
      should have been enough. The flowers, which Gangland sent to prove its
      grief, were put aside because too gay and pleasant. The body was laid upon
      straw. A would-be pallbearer, since his name was Cohen, had to be excluded
      from the rites, as any orthodox Jew could have told him must be the case.
      For death and the dead are unclean; and a Cohen, who by virtue of his name
      is of the high-priest caste&mdash;Aaron was a Cohen&mdash;and tends the
      altars, must touch nothing, approach nothing, that is unclean. The funeral
      was scrupulously held before the second sun went down, and had to be
      hurried a little, because the morgue authorities, hobbled of red tape,
      move as slowly as the sea itself in giving up the dead. The coffin&mdash;of
      poorest pine&mdash;was knocked to pieces in the grave, before the clods of
      earth were shoveled in and the doomsday sods laid on. The garments of him
      who acted as principal mourner were faithfully torn; that is to say, the
      rabbi cut a careful slit in the lapel of that mourner's waistcoat where it
      wouldn't show.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will see from this, that every detail was holy by most ancient Jewish
      prescription. And the business led to talk. Those about Flynn's, Nigger
      Mike's and the Chatham Club, to say naught of members of the Humpty
      Jackson gang, and others who in his latter days had been near if not dear
      to him, confessed that it went far in contradiction of any Spanish or
      Portuguese ancestry for Louie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louie was a mystery, and studied to be so. And to be a mystery is as
      difficult as being a hypocrite. One wrong word, one moment off your guard,
      and lo, a flood of light! The mystery vanishes, the hypocrisy is laid
      bare. You are no longer a riddle. Or, if so, then a riddle that has been
      solved. And he who was a riddle, but has been solved, is everywhere
      scoffed at and despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louie must have possessed a genius for mystery, since not once did he fall
      down in that difficult rôle. He denied nothing, confirmed nothing, of the
      many tales told about him. A waif-word wagged that he had been in the
      army, without pointing to any regiment; and that he had been in the navy,
      without indicating what boat. Louie, it is to be thought, somewhat
      fostered this confusion. It deepened him as a mystery, and made him more
      impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louie was careful, also, that his costume should assist. He made up all in
      black&mdash;black shoes, black trousers, black coat, black hat of
      semi-sombrero type. Even in what may be spoken of as the matter of linen&mdash;although
      there was no linen about it&mdash;he adhered to that funereal hue, and in
      lieu of a shirt wore a sweater, collar close up to the chin, and all as
      black as his coat. As he walked the streets, black eyes challenging,
      threatening, from underneath the black, wide-rimmed hat, he showed not
      from top to toe a fleck of white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among what tales went here and there concerning Louie, there was one which
      described him as the deadest of dead shots. This he accentuated by a brace
      of big Colt's pistols, which bore him constant company, daylight and dark.
      There was no evidence of his having used this artillery, no word of any
      killing to his perilous glory. Indeed, he couldn't have pointed to so much
      as one wounded man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once did those pistols come into play. Valenski's stuss house, in
      Third Avenue near Fourteenth Street, was put in the air. The hold-ups
      descended upon Valenski's, grabbed $80 which was on the table, and sent
      Valenski into his safe for $300 more. While this went on, Louie stood in
      the door, a gun in each fist, defying the gaping, staring, pop-eyed public
      to interfere. He ran no risk, as everyone well knew. The East Side, while
      valorous, never volunteers. There was no more chance of outside
      interference to save Valenski from being plundered, than of outside
      contributions to make him up another roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident might have helped in building up for Louie a reputation, had
      it not been that all that was starkly heroic therein melted when, two days
      later, the ravished $380 was privily restored to Valenski, with the
      assurance that the entire business was a jest. Valenski knew nothing
      humorous had been intended, and that his bundle was returned in deference
      only to the orders of one high in politics and power. Also, it was the
      common feeling, a feeling no less cogent for not being put into words,
      that had Louie been of the wood from which champions are carved, the $380
      would never have come back. To refrain from some intended stick-up upon
      grave orders given, might mean no more than prudence and a right
      discipline. But to send back money, once in actual hand and when the risk
      and work of which it stood the harvest had been encountered and performed,
      was to fly in the face of gang ethics. An order to that effect, however
      eminent its source, should have been met with stony refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one tale which should go, perhaps, to the right side of the
      reputational ledger, as indicating that Louie had nerve. Crazy Charlie was
      found dead in the mouth of a passageway, which opened off Mulberry Street
      near the Bowery. His throat had been cut from ear to ear. No one of sense
      supposed Louie did that throat slashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crazy Charlie was a hop-head, without a dollar in his jeans, and Louie
      never did anything except for money. He would no more have gone about a
      profitless killing, than he would have wasted time and effort by fishing
      in a bathtub.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, on the whispered hint of the Ghost&mdash;who himself was
      killed finally as a snitch&mdash;two plain-clothes men from the Eldridge
      Street station grabbed Louie. They did not tell him the reason of the
      pinch. Neither did they spread it on the books. The police have a habit of
      protecting themselves from the consequences of a foolish collar by a
      specious system of concealment, and put nothing on the blotter until sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When searched at the desk, Louie's guns were discovered. Also, from inside
      his waistcoat was taken a seven-inch knife, which, as said the police
      sergeant, might have slit the windpipe of Crazy Charlie or any other bug.
      But, as anyone with eyes might see, the knife was as purely virginal as
      when it came from a final emery wheel in its far-off Sheffield home. It
      had slit nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, those plain-clothes dicks did not despair. They hoped to startle
      Louie into a confession. With a view to his moral and physical stampede,
      they conveyed Louie in a closed patrol wagon, at mirk midnight, to the
      morgue. He hadn't been told what he was charged with; he didn't know where
      he was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wagon backed up to the morgue door. Louie had never visited the morgue
      before, though fated in the end to appear there officially. The
      plainclothes men, one at each shoulder, steered him inside. All was thick
      blackness; you couldn't have seen your own nose. Feeling their wordless
      way, the painstaking plain-clothes folk manhandled Louie into position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they flashed on a flood of electric light.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, within two feet of Louie, and squarely beneath his eyes, lay the
      dead Crazy Charlie, posed so as to show effectively that gruesome slash
      across the throat. Louie neither started nor exclaimed. Gazing down on the
      dead Charlie, he searched forth a cigarette and turned to one of his
      plain-clothes escorts for a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see this?&rdquo; demanded the plain-clothes man, slewing round the dead
      head until that throat-gash yawned like some horrid mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain-clothes man was wroth to think he should have worked so hard to
      achieve so little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; retorted Louie, as cold as a wedge. &ldquo;Also, I'll tell you bulls
      another thing. You think to rattle me. Say, for ten cents I'd sit on this
      stiff all night an' smoke a pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those plain-clothes artists gave Louie up. They turned him loose at the
      morgue door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair worked round, and helped Louie to a better position in the
      minds of all fair men. It fell in lucky, too, since it more than stood off
      a setback which overtook him about the same time. Louie had called upon
      the Irish Wop, at the latter's poolroom in Fourth Avenue. This emigrant
      from Mayo was thin and slight and sickly, and Louie argued that he might
      bully him out of a handful of money. Putting on a darkest frown, he
      demanded fifty dollars, and intimated that dire indeed would be the
      consequences of refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Louie, &ldquo;when I go out for anything I get it, see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wop coughed timidly and made a suggestion. &ldquo;Come round in half an
      hour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when the last race from New Orleans is in; I'll have the
      cush ready for yez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louie withdrew, and the Wop shoved the poker into the blazing big-bellied
      stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, that New Orleans race having been run, Louie returned. The
      poker being by this time white-hot, the Wop drew it forth from the stove.
      There were no stage waits. Applying the poker to the shrinking rear of
      Louie, the Wop compelled that yearner after fifty dollars to leap
      screechingly from a second-storey window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's phwy I puts th' windy up,&rdquo; explained the Wop; &ldquo;I didn't want that
      chape skate to bre-a-ak th' glassh. Indian Louie! Spanish Louie!&rdquo; he
      repeated with measureless contempt. &ldquo;Let me tell youse ginks wan thing.&rdquo;
       This to a circle who had beheld the flight of Louie. &ldquo;If ever that bum
      shows up here ag'in, I'll put him out av business altogether. Does he
      think a two-cint Guinea from Sout' Ameriky can bluff a full-blown Mick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louie's flight through the Wop's window, as had his steadiness at the
      morgue, went the gossipy rounds. It didn't injure him as much as you might
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For who,&rdquo; said the general voice, &ldquo;would face and fight a white-hot
      poker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, public sentiment was inclined to sustain Louie in that
      second-storey jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what has been written, it will not astonish you to hear that, upon
      the important matter of courage, Louie's place in society had not been
      absolutely fixed. Some said one thing, some another. There are game men in
      Gangland; and there exist others who aren't the real thing. Sardinia Frame
      believes, with the Irish Wop, that Louie belonged in the latter class.
      Also, Sardinia Frank is entitled to an opinion. For he was born in
      Mulberry Bend, and has himself been tried twice on charges of murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sardinia Frank, by the way, who smote upon Eat-'em-up Jack with
      that effective lead pipe, albeit, there being no proof, he was never
      arrested for it. No, he doesn't admit it, even among intimates and where
      such admission would be respected as sacred. But when joked concerning it,
      he has ever worn a cheerful, satisfied look&mdash;like the pictures of the
      cat that ate the canary&mdash;and while careful not to accept, was equally
      careful not to reject, the compliment implied. Moreover, when the dead
      Eat-'em-up-Jack was picked up, the lead pipe used to break his skull had
      been tucked jocosely under his arm. It was clear to knowing ones that none
      except Sardinia Frank would have thought of such a jest. To him it would
      have come readily enough, since death always appealed to his sense of
      humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clad in a Tuxedo and an open-face suit, Sardinia Frank, at the time I
      questioned him, was officiating as peace-preserver in the Normandie
      rathskeller. By way of opener, I spoke of his mission on the rathskeller
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm here to keep out everybody I know,&rdquo; said he simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pathetic side to this which, in his ingenuousness, Frank
      failed wholly to remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Indian Louie?&rdquo; I at last said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was within an hour after Louie had been killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell youse about Louie,&rdquo; returned Frank. &ldquo;Of course, he's dead, an'
      lyin' on a slab in th' morgue right now. They 'phoned me woid ten minutes
      ago. But that don't make no difference. He was a bluff; he wasn't th'
      goods. He went around wit' his hat over his eyes, bulldozin' everybody he
      could, an' lettin' on to be a hero. An' he's got what heroes get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever get tangled up with him?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me show you,&rdquo; and Frank became confidential. &ldquo;This'll give youse a
      line. One time he's got two hundred bones. Mollie Squint climbs into a
      yap-wagon an' touches a rube for it. Louie takes it, an' plants it wit'
      Nigger Mike. That's about six months ago. Th' next night, me bein' wise to
      it, I chases to Mike an' says, 'Louie's over to Jigger's, pointin' stuss,
      an' he wants th' two hundred.' So Mike hands me th' dough. I splits it
      five ways wit' th' gang who's along, each of us gettin' his little old bit
      of forty dollars apiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louie, when he finds out next day, makes an awful beef. He tells
      everybody he's goin' to hand it to me&mdash;goin' to cook me on sight,
      see? I hears of it, an' I hunts Louie up in Jack Sirocco's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Say, Louie,' I says, 'about that cookin' me. Th' bully way would be to
      come right now over to Hoboken, an' bump me off to-night. I'll go wit'
      youse. An' there won't be no hang-over, see; 'cause no one in Joisey'll
      care, an' no one in New York'll know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do youse think Louie'll come? Not on your necktie! He didn't want me game&mdash;just
      wanted to talk, that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Not youse, Frank,' he said; 'I ain't gunnin' for youse. It's Nigger
      Mike; he's th' guy I'm goin' to croak. He oughtn't to have let youse have
      th' money.' No, of course, he don't go after Mike; that's simply his
      crawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it from me,&rdquo; Frank concluded, &ldquo;Louie wasn't th' goods. He'd run a
      bluff, but he never really hoited a guy in his whole life. As I says, he
      goes about frownin', an' glarin', an' givin' people th' fiery eye, an'
      t'rowin' a chest, an' lettin' it go broadcast that he's a hero. An' for a
      finish he's got w'at heroes get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the word of Sardinia Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he fell with two bullets through his brain, and two more through his
      body, Louie had $170 in his pocket, $700 in his shoe, and $3,000 in the
      Bowery Bank. This prosperity needn't amaze. There was, for one thing, a
      racket reason to be hereinafter set forth. Besides, Pretty Agnes and
      Mollie Squint both walked the streets in Louie's loved behalf, and brought
      him all in the way of riches that came to their lure. Either was sure for
      five dollars a day, and Mollie Squint, who could graft a little, once came
      in with $800. Both Pretty Agnes and Mollie Squint most fiercely adored
      Louie, and well did he know how to play one loving heart against the
      other. Some say that of the pair he preferred Pretty Agnes. If so, he
      wasn't fool enough to let her find it out. She might have neglected her
      business to bask in his sweet society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, when it came to that, Louie's heart was really given to a blonde
      burlesquer, opulent of charm. This <i>artiste</i> snubbed and neglected
      Louie for the love of a stage manager. But she took and spent Louie's
      money, almost if not quite as fast as Pretty Agnes and Mollie Squint could
      bring it to him from the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louie never made any place his hangout long. There was no element of
      loyalty in him, whether for man or for woman, and he went from friend to
      friend and gang to gang. He would stay nowhere, remain with no one, after
      his supremacy had been challenged. And such hardy natures as Biff Ellison,
      Jimmy Kelly, Big Mike Abrams, Chick Tricker and Jack Sirocco were bound to
      challenge it. They had a way, too, of putting the acid on an individual,
      and unless his fighting heart were purest gold they'd surely find it out.
      And Louie never stood the test. Thus, beginning at Big Jack's in Chatham
      Square, Louie went from hangout to hangout, mob to mob, until, working
      through Nigger Mike's, the Chatham Club and Sharkey's, he came at last to
      pal in with the Humpty Jackson guerrillas.
    </p>
    <p>
      These worthies had a stamping ground in a graveyard between First and
      Second Avenue, in the block bounded north and south by Twelfth and
      Thirteenth Streets. There Louie was wont to meet such select company as
      Monahokky, Nigger Ruhl, Candy Phil, the Lobster Kid, Maxie Hahn, and the
      Grabber. As they lolled idly among the tombstones, he would give them his
      adventures by flood and by field. Louie, besides being conceited, was
      gifted with an imagination and liked to hear himself talk. Not that he
      felt obliged to accuracy in these narrations. It was enough that he made
      them thrilling, and in their telling shed an effulgent ray upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he could entertain with his stories, Louie was never popular. There
      was that doubt about his courage. Also, he was too frugal. No one had ever
      caught the color of his money. Save in the avaricious instance of the big
      blonde burlesquer, as hungry as false, he held by the selfish theology
      that it is more blessed to receive than to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking one reason and another, those about Louie at the finish were mainly
      the Humpty Jackson bunch. His best hangout of any fashion was the Hesper
      Club. Had Humpty Jackson remained with his own, Louie might have been
      driven, in search of comradeship, to go still further afield. Humpty was
      no weakling, and while on the surface a whining, wheedling, complaining
      cripple, owned his volcanic side, and had once shot it out, gun to gun and
      face to face, with no less a paladin than Jimmy Kelly. Louie would have
      found the same fault with Humpty that he had found with those others. Only
      Humpty didn't last long enough after Louie joined his forces. Some robbery
      came off, and a dull jury held Humpty responsible. With that, the judge
      sent him up for a long term of years, and there he sticks to-day. Humpty
      took the journey crying that he had been jobbed by the police. However
      that may have been, his going made it possible for Louie to remain with
      the Jacksons, and shine at those ghoulish, graveyard meetings, much longer
      than might otherwise have been the case.

      While Louie had removed to the remote regions about Fourteenth Street and
      Third Avenue, and was seldom seen in Chatham Square or Chinatown, he was
      not forgotten in those latter precincts. Jew Yetta brought up his name one
      evening in the Chatham Club, and spoke scornfully of him in conjunction
      with the opulent blonde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doll's makin' a farmer of Louie,&rdquo; was the view of Jew Yetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that,&rdquo; remarked the Dropper&mdash;for this was in the days of his
      liberty and before he had been put away&mdash;&ldquo;farmer or no farmer, it's
      comin' easier for him now than when he was in the navy, eatin' sow-belly
      out of a harness cask an' drinkin' bilge. W'at's that ship he says he's
      sailin' in, Nailer?&rdquo; continued the Dropper. &ldquo;Ain't it a tub called <i>Atalanta?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never is a ship in the navy named <i>Atalanta</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This declaration, delivered with emphasis, emanated from old Jimmy, who
      had a place by himself in East Side consideration. Old Jimmy was about
      sixty, with a hardwood-finish face and 'possum-colored hair. He had been a
      river pirate in the old days, and roamed the midnight waters for what he
      might pick up. Those were times when he troubled the police, who made him
      trouble in return. But one day old Jimmy salvaged a rich man's daughter,
      who&mdash;as though to make his fortune&mdash;had fallen overboard from a
      yacht, and bored her small hole in the water within a rod or two of
      Jimmy's skiff. Certainly, he fished her out, and did it with a boat hook.
      More; he sagaciously laid her willowy form across a thwart, to the end
      that the river water flow more easily from her rosebud mouth. Relieved of
      the water, the rescued beauty thanked Jimmy profusely; and, for his
      generous part, her millionaire father proceeded to pension his child's
      preserver for life. The pension was twenty-five dollars a week. Coming
      fresh and fresh with every Monday, Jimmy gave up his piracies and no
      longer haunted in the name of loot the nightly reaches of the river.
      Indeed, he became offensively idle and honest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; repeated old Jimmy; &ldquo;there never is a ship in our navy named <i>Atalanta</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All th' same,&rdquo; retorted the dropper, &ldquo;I lamps a yacht once w'at's called
      <i>Atalanta</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' who says No?&rdquo; demanded old Jimmy, testily. &ldquo;I'm talkin' about th'
      United States Navy. But speakin' of Louie, it ain't no cinch he's ever in
      th 'navy. I'd sooner bet he's been in jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' if he was,&rdquo; said Jew Yetta, &ldquo;there ain't no one here who's got
      anything on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at does Atalanta mean, anyway?&rdquo; questioned the Dropper, who didn't like
      the talk of jails. &ldquo;Is it a place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nixie,&rdquo; put in Slimmy, the erudite, ever ready to display his learning.
      &ldquo;Atalanta's the name of a skirt, who b'longs 'way back. She's some soon as
      a sprinter, too, an' can run her one hundred yards in better than ten
      seconds. Every god on Olympus clocked this dame, an' knew what she could
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at's her story?&rdquo; asked the Dropper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gets along, d'ye see, where Atalanta's folks thinks she ought to get
      married. But she won't have it; she'd sooner be a sprinter. With that,
      they crowd her hand; an' to get shut of 'em, she finally tacks it up on
      the bulletin board that she'll chase to th' altar only with some student
      who can beat her at a quarter mile dash. 'No lobsters need apply!' says
      she. Also, there's conditions. Under the rules, if some chump calls th'
      bluff, an' can't make good&mdash;if she lands him loses&mdash;her papa's
      headsman will be on th' job with his axe, an' that beaten gink'll get his
      block whacked off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' does any one go against such a game?&rdquo; queried Jew Yetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! A whole fleet of young Archibalds and Reginalds went up ag'inst it.
      They all lose; an' his jiblets wit' th' cleaver chops off their youthful
      beans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the luck turns. One day a sure-thing geek shows up whose monaker is
      Hippomenes. Hippy's a fly Indian; there ain't goin' to be no headsman in
      his. Hippy's hep to skirts, too, an' knows where th' board is off their
      fence. He organizes with three gold apples, see, an' every time little
      Atalanta Shootin' Star goes flashin' by, he chucks down one of 'em in
      front of her. She simply eats it up; she can't get by not one; an' she
      loses so much time grabbin' for 'em, Hippy noses in a winner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; broke forth the Dropper. &ldquo;An' do they hook up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're married; but it don't last. You see its Venus who shows Hippy how
      to crab Atalanta's act an' stakes him to th' gold apples. An' later, when
      he double-crosses Venus, that goddess changes him an' his baby mine into
      a-couple of lions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Irish Wop had been listening impatiently. It was when Governor Hughes
      flourished in Albany, and the race tracks were being threatened. The Wop,
      as a pool-room keeper, was vastly concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the Wop, appealing directly to old Jimmy as the East Side
      Nestor, &ldquo;that la-a-ad Hughes is makin' it hot for Belmont an' Keene an'
      th' rist av th' racin' gang. Phwat's he so ha-a-ard on racin' for? Do yez
      look on playin' th' ponies as a vice, Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; responded old Jimmy with a conservative air, &ldquo;I don't know as I'd
      call it a vice so much as a bonehead play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They call it th' shpo-r-rt av kings,&rdquo; observed die Wop, loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jimmy snorted. &ldquo;Sport of kings!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Sport of come-ons, rather.
      Them Sport-of-kings gezebos 'll go on, too, an' give you a lot of guff
      about racin' bein' healthy. But they ain't sayin' a word concernin' th'
      mothers an' youngones livin' in hot two-room tenements, an' jumpin'
      sideways for grub, while th' husbands and fathers is blowin' in their
      bank-rolls in th' bettin' ring, an' gettin' healthy. An' th' little jocks,
      too&mdash;mere kids! I've wondered th' Gerries didn't get after 'em. But I
      suppose th' Gerries know who to pass up, an' who to pinch, as well as th'
      oldest skipper on th' Force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F'r all that,&rdquo; contended the Wop, stubbornly, &ldquo;thim la-a-ads that's mixed
      up wit' th' racin' game is good feltys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good fellows,&rdquo; repeated old Jimmy with contempt. &ldquo;I recollect seein' a
      picture once, a picture of a girl&mdash;a young wife, she is&mdash;lyin'
      with her head on an untouched dinner table&mdash;fallen asleep, poor
      thing! Th' clock in the picture is pointin' to midnight. There she's been
      waitin' with th' dinner she's cooked with her own little lovin' mitts, for
      that souse of a husband to come home. Under th' picture it says, 'For he's
      a jolly good fellow!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody'd ought to have put a head on him!&rdquo; quoth Jew Yetta, whose
      sympathies were both active and militant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; went on Jimmy, &ldquo;that picture gets on my nerves. A week later I'm
      down be th' old Delmonico joint at Twenty-sixth an' Broadway. It's meb-by
      one o'clock in th' mornin'. As I'm goin' by th' Twenty-sixt' Street door,
      out floats a fleet of Willies, stewed to the gills, singin' in honor of a
      dude who's in th' middle, 'For he's a jolly good fellow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Who's that galoot?' I asks th' dub who's slammin' carriage doors at the
      curb. 'Is he a married man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He's married all right,&rdquo; says th' door-slammin' dub.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wit that I tears into him. It's a good while ago, an' I could slug a
      little. Be th' time th' copper gets there, I've got that jolly good fellow
      lookin' like he'd been caught whistlin' <i>Croppies Lie Down</i> at
      Fiftieth Street an' Fift' Avenoo when th' Cathedral lets out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm not married,&rdquo; remarked the Wop, snappishly;&mdash;&ldquo;I'm not
      married; I niver was married; an' I niver will be married aloive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did youse notice?&rdquo; remarked the Dropper, &ldquo;how they gets a roar out of old
      Boss Croker? He's for racin' all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said old Jimmy. &ldquo;Him ownin' race horses, Croker's for th'
      race tracks. He don't cut no ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do yez figger Croker had cleaned up, Jimmy, when he made his
      getaway for Ireland?&rdquo; asked the Wop, licking an envious lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without comin' down to book-keepin',&rdquo; returned old Jimmy, carelessly, &ldquo;my
      understandin' is that, be havin' th' whole wad changed into thousand
      dollar bills, he's able to get it down to th' dock on a dray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Grabber came in. He beckoned Slimmy, and the two were at once immersed
      in serious whisperings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are youse two stews chinnin' about?&rdquo; called out the Dropper lazily,
      from across the room. &ldquo;Be youse thinkin' of orderin' th' beer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about Indian Louie,&rdquo; replied Slimmy, angrily. &ldquo;Th' Grabber here says
      Louie's out to skin us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indian Louie,&rdquo; remarked the Wop, with a gleam in his little gray eye.
      &ldquo;That's th' labberick w'at's goin' to shti-i-ick up me poolroom f'r thim
      fifty bones. Anny wan that'd have annything to do wit' a bum loike him
      ought to get skinned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at's he tryin' to saw off on youse?&rdquo; asked the Dropper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is th' proposition.&rdquo; It was the Grabber now. &ldquo;Me an' Slimmy here
      goes in wit' Louie to give that racket last week in Tammany Hall. Now
      Louie's got th' whole bundle, an' he won't split it. Me an' Slimmy's been
      t'run down for six hundred good iron dollars apiece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' be yez goin' to let him get away wit' it?&rdquo; demanded the Wop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at can we do?&rdquo; asked the Grabber, disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that big blonde,&rdquo; declared Jew Yetta' with acrimony. &ldquo;She's goin'
      through Louie for every dollar. I wonder Mollie Squint an' Pretty Agnes
      don't put her on th' fritz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Hesper Club was in Second Avenue between Sixth and Seventh Streets. It
      was one o'clock in the morning when Indian Louie took his accustomed seat
      at the big table in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's everybody?&rdquo; he asked, easily. &ldquo;I oversleeps meself, or I'd been
      here hours ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at tires you?&rdquo; asked Candy Phil. Not that he cared, but merely by way
      of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's th' big feed last night at Terrace Garden. I'm two days trainin' for
      it, an' all day gettin' over it. Them swell blowouts is something fierce!&rdquo;
       and Louie assumed a wan and weary air, intended to be superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you was at Terrace Garden?&rdquo; said Nigger Ruhl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I? Youse should have seen me! Patent leathers, white choker, and a
      diamond in th' middle of me three-sheet big enough to trip a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothin' in them dress suits,&rdquo; protested Maxie Hahn. &ldquo;I'm ag'inst
      'em; they ain't dimmycratic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All th' same, youse've got to wear 'em at these swell feeds,&rdquo; said Candy
      Phil. &ldquo;They'd give youse th' gate if you don't. An' as for not bein'
      dimmycratic&rdquo;&mdash;Candy Phil had his jocose side&mdash;&ldquo;they make it so
      you can't tell th' high-guys from th' waiters, an' if that ain't
      dimmycratic what is? Th' only thing I know ag'inst 'em is that youse can't
      go to th' floor wit' a guy in 'em. You've got to cut out th' scrappin',
      an' live up to the suit, see?&rdquo; The Grabber strolled in, careless and
      smiling. Louie fastened him with eyes of dark suspicion, while Maxie Hahn,
      the' Lobster Kid and Candy Phil began pushing their chairs out of the line
      of possible fire. For they knew of those monetary differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a chance, sports,&rdquo; remarked the Grabber, reassuringly. &ldquo;No one's
      goin' to start anything. Let's take a drink,&rdquo; and the Grabber beat upon
      the table as a sign of thirst. &ldquo;I ain't after no one here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be youse alludin' to me, Grabber?&rdquo; asked Louie, with a frown like a great
      cloud. &ldquo;I don't like them cracks about startin' somethin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your shoit on,&rdquo; expostulated the Grabber, clinking down the change
      for the round of beers; &ldquo;keep your shoit on, Louie. I ain't alludin' at
      nobody nor nothin', least of all at youse. Besides, I just gets a message
      for you&mdash;only you don't seem in no humor to receive it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's it from?&rdquo; asked Louie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Laura&rdquo;&mdash;Laura was the opulent blonde&mdash;&ldquo;Mollie Squint an'
      Pretty Agnes runs up on her about an hour ago at Twelfth Street an' Second
      Avenoo, an' Mollie bounces a brick off her coco. A copper comes along an'
      chases Mollie an' Pretty Agnes. I gets there as they're carry in' Laura
      into that Dago's joint be th' corner. Laura asks me if I sees youse to
      tell w'at's happened her; that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Mollie and Agnes sloughed in?&rdquo; asked Louie, whose practical mind went
      first to his breadwinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they faded into th' next street. Th' cop don't want to pinch 'em
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Laura; was she hoited much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten stiches, an' a week in Roosevelt Hospital; that's the best she can
      get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must chase round an' look her over,&rdquo; was Louie's anxious conclusion.
      &ldquo;W'at's that Dago joint she's at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's be th' corner,&rdquo; said the Grabber, &ldquo;an' up stairs. I forgets the
      wop's monaker.&rdquo; As Louie hesitated over these vague directions, the
      Grabber set down his glass. &ldquo;Say, to show there's no hard feelin', I'll go
      wit' youse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Louie and the Grabber disappeared through the door, Candy Phil threw up
      both hands as one astonished to the verge of nervous shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, w'at do youse think of that?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I always figgered
      Louie had bats in his belfry; now I knows it. They'll croak him sure!&rdquo;
       Nigger Ruhl and the Lobster Kid arose as though to follow. At this, Candy
      Phil broke out fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at's wrong wit' youse stews? Stick where you be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they'll cook Louie!&rdquo; expostulated the Lobster Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't no skin off your nose if they do. W'y should youse go buttin'
      in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louie and the Grabber were in Twelfth Street, hurrying towards Second
      Avenue. Not a soul, except themselves, was abroad. The Grabber walked on
      Louie's right, which showed that either the latter was not the gunplayer
      he pretended, or the word from Laura had thrown him off his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as the pair passed a dark hallway, the Grabber's left arm stole
      round Louie's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that dough, Louie!&rdquo; hissed the Grabber, at the same time tightening
      his left arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louie half turned to free himself from the artful Grabber. As he did so,
      the Grabber's ready right hand brought his pistol into action, and one
      bullet and then another flashed through Louie's brain. A slim form rushed
      out of the dark hallway, and fired two bullets into Louie's body. Louie
      was dead before he struck the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grabber, with his slim companion, darted through the dark hallway, out
      a rear door and over a back fence. Sixty seconds later they were quietly
      walking in Thirteenth Street, examples of law-abiding peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was th' easiest ever, Slimmy!&rdquo; whispered the Grabber, when he had
      recovered his breath. &ldquo;I knew that stall about Laura'd fetch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was at th' Hesper Club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On'y Candy Phil, th' Lobster Kid an' two or three other blokes. Every one
      of 'em's a right guy. They won't rap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thim la-a-ads,&rdquo; remarked the Wop, judiciously, when he heard of Louie's
      taking off&mdash;&ldquo;thim la-a-ads musht 'av lost their heads. There's six or
      seven hundred bones on that bum, an' they niver copped a splinter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word came two ways to the Central Office. One report said &ldquo;Indian
      Louie&rdquo; and another &ldquo;Johnny Spanish.&rdquo; Detective O'Farrell invaded
      Chinatown, and dug up Big Mike Abrams, that the doubt might be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Indian Louie, all right,&rdquo; said Big Mike, following a moment's silent
      survey of the rigid form. Then, in a most unlooked for vein of sentiment:
      &ldquo;They all get here at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no dream!&rdquo; agreed the morgue attendant. &ldquo;An', say, Mike&rdquo;&mdash;he
      liked his joke as well as any other&mdash;&ldquo;I've been expectin' you for
      some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; returned Big Mike, with a friendly grin; &ldquo;I'll come chasin' along,
      feet foist, some mornin'. But don't forget that while I'm waitin' I'm
      workin'. I've sent two stiffs down here to youse already, to help keep you
      goin' till I comes. Accordin' to th' chances, however, me own turn
      oughtn't to be so very far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Mike Abram's turn was just three weeks away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were those two, Mike, you sent down here to the morgue?&rdquo; asked
      O'Farrell, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Farrell had a catlike fame for slyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; grinned Big Mike, derisively; &ldquo;look me over! I ain't wearin' no
      medals, am I, for givin' meself up to you bulls?&rdquo;
     </p>

      VI.&mdash;HOW JACKEEN SLEW THE DOC
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n person he was
      tall, languid, slender, as neat as a cat, and his sallow face&mdash;over
      which had settled the opium pallor&mdash;was not an ugly face. Also, there
      abode such weakness, some good, and no harm in him. His constitution was
      rickety. In the winter he coughed and invited pneumonia; in the summer,
      when the sun poured down, he trembled on the brink of a stroke. But
      neither pneumonia nor sunstroke ever quite killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was written that Jackeen would do that&mdash;Jackeen Dalton, <i>alias</i>
      Brady; and Jackeen did it with five bullets from an automatic-38. Some
      said that opium was at the bottom of it; others laid it to love. It is
      still greatly talked over in what pipe joints abound in Mott, Pell and
      Doyers, not to mention the wider Catherine Street, in the neighborhood of
      number Nineteen, where he had his flat and received his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      They called him the Doc. Twenty years ago the Doc studied dentistry with
      his father, who flourished reputably as a tooth surgeon at the Troy Dental
      Parlors in Roosevelt Street. The father died before the Doc had been given
      a diploma; and the Doc, having meanwhile picked up the opium habit, was
      never able afterwards to see the use. Why should he be examined or ask for
      a license? What foolishness! Magnanimously waving aside every thought of
      the sort, he plunged into the practice of his cheerless art among those
      who went in and out of Chinatown, and who lived precariously by
      pocket-picking, porch-climbing, safe-blowing and all-round strong-arm
      methods; and, careless of the statute in such case made and provided, he
      proceeded to file and drill and cap and fill and bridge and plug and pull
      their aching cuspids, bicuspids and molars, and all with as quick an
      instinct and as deft a touch as though his eyes were sharpened and his
      hand made steady by the dental sheepskins of a dozen colleges. That he was
      an outlaw among tooth-drawers served only to knit him more closely to the
      hearts of his patients&mdash;themselves merest outlaws among men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doc kept his flat in Catherine Street as bright and burnished as the
      captain's cabin of a man-of-war. There was no prodigious wealth of
      furniture, no avalanche of ornament to overwhelm the taste. Aside from an
      outfit of dental tools, the most expensive belongings appeared to be what
      lamps and pipes and kindred paraphernalia were required in the smoking of
      opium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who visited the Doc were compelled to one formality. Before he would
      open his door, they must push the bell four times and four times tap on
      the panel. Thus did they prove their friendly identity. Lawful dentists,
      in their jealousy, had had the Doc arrested and fined, from time to time,
      for intromitting with the teeth of his fellow worms without a license.
      Hence that precautionary quartet of rings, followed by the quartet of
      taps, indicative that a friend and not a foe was at his gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doc had many callers who came to smoke opium. For these he did divers
      kindly offices, mostly in the letter-writing line. As they reclined and
      smoked, they dictated while the Doc transcribed, and many and weird were
      the epistles from Nineteen Catherine Street which found their way into the
      mails. For this service, as for his opium and dentistry, the Doc's callers
      never failed to press upon him an honorarium. And so he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love, that flowerlike sentiment for which&mdash;as some jurist once
      remarked of justice&mdash;all places are palaces, all seasons summer, is
      not incompatible with either dentistry or opium. The Doc had a sweetheart
      named Lulu. Lulu was very beautiful and very jealous. Also, she was
      broadly popular. All Chinatown made songs to the deep glories of her eyes,
      which were supposed to have excited the defeated envy of many stars. The
      Doc, in what odd hours he could snatch from tooth-drawing and
      opium-smoking, worshipped at the shrine of Lulu; and Lulu was wrapped up
      in the Doc. Number Nineteen Catherine Street served as their Garden of
      Eden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it is among the many defects of opium that it renders migratory the
      fancy. An ebon evidence of this was to be given at number Nineteen. The I
      love of the Doc became, as it were, pipe-deflected, and one day left Lulu,
      and, after a deal of fond circling, settled like some errant dove upon a
      rival belle called May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, there was a dangerous side to this dulcet, new situation. The
      enchanting May, when the Doc chose her for his goddess, vice Lulu thrown
      down, could not be described as altogether disengaged. Was she not also
      the goddess of Jackeen? Had not that earnest safe-robber laid his heart at
      her feet?
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, there were reasons even more substantial. The gentle May was in
      her way a breadwinner. When the fortunes of Jackeen were low, she became
      their mutual meal-ticket. May was the most expert shoplifter in all of
      broad New York. If not upon heart arguments, then upon arguments of the
      pocket, not to say stomach, Jackeen might be expected to fiercely resent
      any effort to win her love away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeen?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not much is to be told by an appearance, although physiognomists have sung
      otherwise. The egg of the eagle is less impressive than the egg of: the
      goose. And yet it hotly houses in its heart an' eagle. The egg of the
      nightingale shows but-meanly side by side with the egg of the crow. And:
      yet it hides within its modest bosom the limpid music of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it is with men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeen was not an imposing personality. But neither is the tarantula. He
      was five feet and an inch in stunted stature, and weighed a mean shadow
      under one hundred and ten pounds. Like the Doc&mdash;who had stolen his
      love away&mdash;Jackeen's hollow cheeks were of that pasty gray which
      speaks of opium. Also, from opium, the pupils of his vermin eyes had
      become as the points of two dull pins. Shrivelled, degenerate, a tattered
      rag of humanity, Jackeen was none the less a perilous spirit, and so the
      Doc&mdash;too late&mdash;would learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that Eden at Nineteen Catherine Street, the fair Lulu had been put
      into the street. This was to make pleasant room for the visits of the
      fairer May. Jackeen was untroubled, knowing nothing about it. He was for
      the moment too wholly engaged, being in the throes of a campaign against
      the Savoy theatre safe, from which strongbox he looked forward to a
      harvest of thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desolate Lulu went everywhere seeking Jackeen, to tell him of his
      wrongs. Her search was vain; those plans touching the Savoy safe had
      withdrawn him from his accustomed haunts. One night, however, the safe was
      blown and plundered. Alas and alack! Jackeen's share, from those hoped-for
      thousands, dwindled to a paltry sixty dollars&mdash;not enough for a
      single spree!
    </p>
    <p>
      In his resentment, Jackeen, with the aid of a bevy of friends, hastily
      stuck-up a wayfarer, whom he met in Division Street. The wayfarer's
      pockets proved empty. It was even more of a waterhaul than had been the
      Savoy safe. The double disappointment turned Jackeen's mood to gall and it
      was while his humor was thus bilious that he one day walked into the
      Chatham Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a distinguished company gathered at the Chatham Club. Nannie
      Miller, Blinky the Lob-bygow, Dago Angelo, Roxie, Jimida, Johnny Rice,
      Stagger, Jimmy Foy, and St. Louis Bill&mdash;all were there. And these
      were but a handful of what high examples sat about the Chatham Club, and
      with calls for beer, and still more beer, kept Nigger Mike and his
      assistants on the joyful jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jackeen came in, Mike greeted him warmly, and placed a chair next to
      that of Johnny Rice. Conversation broke out concerning the dead and
      departed Kid Twist. While Twist was an Eastman and an enemy of Roxie&mdash;himself
      of the Five Points&mdash;the latter was no less moved to speak in highest
      terms of him. He defended this softness by remarking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twist's dead, see! An' once a guy's been put to bed wit' a shovel, if
      youse can't speak well of him youse had better can gabbin' about him
      altogether. Them's my sentiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dago Angelo, who had been a friend of the vanished Twist, applauded this,
      and ordered beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twist&mdash;according to the veracious Roxie&mdash;had not been wanting in
      brilliancy as a Captain of Industry. He had showed himself ingenious when
      he took his poolroom into the Hatmakers' Union, as a safeguard against
      raids by the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon another occasion, strictly commercial&mdash;so said Roxie&mdash;Twist
      had displayed a generalship which would have glorified a Rockefeller. Baby
      Flax, named for the soft innocuousness of his countenance, kept a grogshop
      in Houston Street. One quiet afternoon Twist abruptly broke that cherubic
      publican's windows, mirrors, glasses, bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lighting a cigar, Twist stood in the midst of that ruin undismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up?&rdquo; demanded the policeman, who came hot-foot to the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; vouchsafed Twist, between puffs, &ldquo;there's a party chases in,
      smashes things, an' then beats it up the street wit'out sayin' a woid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman looked at Baby Flax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's straight,&rdquo; chattered that ill-used proprietor, who, with the
      dangerous eye of Twist upon him, wouldn't have told the truth for gold and
      precious stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What started youse, Twist?&rdquo; asked a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's this way,&rdquo; explained Twist. &ldquo;I'm introducin' a celery bitters&mdash;because
      there's cush in it. I goes into Baby Flax's an' asks him to buy. He hands
      me out a 'No!' So I ups an' puts his joint on the bum. After this, when I
      come into a dump, they'll buy me bitters, see! Sure, I cops an order for
      two cases from Flax before I leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Twist to sleep in peace, and by way of turning the laugh on that
      gentleman, Roxie related an adventure with Nigger Mike. It was when that
      sub-chief of the Eastmans kept at number Twelve Pell, by word of the
      vivacious Roxie, he, with certain roysterers belonging to the Five Points,
      had gone to Mike's to drink beer. They were the foe. But no less he served
      them, as he was doing now, for such was and is the bland etiquette of the
      gangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      One o'clock struck, and Mike locked his door. Key turned, the beer flowed
      on unchecked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half after one, when Mike himself was a law-breaker under the excise
      statute by full thirty criminal minutes, Roxie with his Five Points
      merrymakers arose, beat up Mike and his few retainers, skinned the damper
      for fifty bones, and departed singing songs of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike was powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      As was well said by Roxie: &ldquo;W'at could he do? If he makes a roar to th'
      cops for us puttin' his joint in th' air, we'd have whipped one over on
      him for bein' open after hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mike laughed with the rest at Roxie's reminiscence. It was of another day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at's th' matter wit' your mouth, Mike?&rdquo; asked St. Louis Bill, for there
      was a lisping queerness, not only about Mike's talk, but about his laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nigger Mike proceeded to lay bare the causes of that queerness. While
      engaged in a joint debate&mdash;years ago, it was&mdash;with a gentleman
      given as much to sudden petulances as to positive views, he had lost three
      of his teeth. Their place had been artifically but not artistically
      supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' lately they've been feelin' funny,&rdquo; explained Mike, alluding to the
      supplemental teeth, &ldquo;an' I toins 'em over to th' Doc to fix. That guy who
      made 'em for me foist must have been a bum dentist. An' at that, w'at do
      you t'ink he charges? I'm a Dutchman if he don't lash me to th' mast for
      forty bucks! He says th' gold plate is wort' twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mike,&rdquo; said Nannie Miller, who'd been listening, &ldquo;I don't want to
      make you sore, but on the level you talk like your mouth is full of mush.
      I'd make th' Doc come through wit' 'em as soon as I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he'll bring 'em in to-morry,&rdquo; returned Mike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's ten to one you don't see 'em for a week,&rdquo; declared the pessimistic
      St. Louis Bill. &ldquo;Youse can't tell nothin' about them hop-heads. They say
      'to-morry' when they mean next year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      St. Louis Bill, being virtuously superior to opium, never lost a chance to
      speak scornfully of those who couldn't make that boast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike, at the discouraging view expressed, became doleful. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he
      observed, &ldquo;I'd look like a sucker, wouldn't I, if anything happens th'
      Doc, an' I don't get 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      St. Louis Bill assured Mike that he would indeed look like a sucker, and
      re-declared his conviction&mdash;based upon certain occult creepings and
      crawlings in his bones&mdash;that Mike had seen the last of those teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my steer,&rdquo; said St. Louis Bill in conclusion; &ldquo;treat them teeth you
      gives th' Doc as a dead issue, an' go get measured for some more. Twenty
      dollars wort' of gold, you says! It ain't no cinch but the Doc's hocked
      'em for hop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin' to that!&rdquo; returned Mike, decisively. &ldquo;Th' Doc's a square guy.
      Them teeth is all safe enough. Only, as you says, bein' he hits the pipe,
      he may be slow about chasin' in wit' 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Nigger Mike and his guests are in talk, run your eye over the scene.
      Those citizens of Gangland assembled about the Chatham Club tables would
      have made a study, and mayhap a chapter, for Lombroso. Speaking generally,
      they are a stunted litter, these gangmen, and seldom stand taller than
      five feet four. Their weight wouldn't average one hundred and twenty
      pounds. They are apt to run from the onslaught of an outsider. This is not
      perhaps from cowardice; but they dislike exertion, even the exertion of
      fighting, and unless it be to gain money or spoil, or a point of honor is
      involved&mdash;as in their duels and gang wars&mdash;they back away from
      trouble. In their gang battles, or when fighting the police, their
      strategy is to lie flat on the ground and shoot. Thus they save themselves
      a clubbing, and the chances from hostile lead are reduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure there are exceptions. Such as Chick Tricker, Ike the Blood, Big
      Mike Abrams, Jack Sirocco, the Dropper, and the redoubtable Jimmy Kelly
      never fly and always fight. No one ever saw their backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are inclined to doubt the bloody character of those gang battles. Why
      doesn't one hear of them?&mdash;you ask. Because the police conceal as
      much as may be all word and all sign of them. For the public to know might
      get the police criticized, and they are granted enough of that without
      inviting it through any foolish frankness. The hospitals, however, will
      tell you of a weekly average of fifty patients, suffering from knife or
      gun-shot wounds, not to name fractures born of bottles, bricks and
      blackjacks. A bottle judiciously wielded, or a beer stein prudently broken
      in advance to assure a jagged edge, is no mean weapon where warriors are
      many and the fields of battle close.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Roxie rattled on, and the others gave interested ear, Jackeen was
      commenting in discouraged whispers to Johnny Rice on those twin setbacks
      of the Division Street stick-up and the Savoy safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like nobody's got any dough,&rdquo; replied Rice, in a spirit of
      sympathy. &ldquo;Take me own self. I ain't made a touch youse could call a
      touch, for a mont' of Sundays. Me rag, Josie, an' I was chin-nin' about it
      on'y last night, an' Josie herself says she never sees th' town so dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's somethin' fierce!&rdquo; returned Jackeen, moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      More beer, and a moment of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at's you' goil May doin'?&rdquo; asked Rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's graftin' a little,&rdquo; responded Jackeen; &ldquo;but w'at wit' th' stores
      full of private dicks a booster can't do much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can bet May ought to know!&rdquo; returned Rice. &ldquo;As a derrick, she'
      got the Darby Kid an' the best of 'em beat four ways from th' jack. She
      could bring home th' bacon, if any of them hoisters could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then appeared Lulu the houseless&mdash;Lulu, the forlorn and outcast Eve
      of that Catherine Street Eden!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lulu stood a polite moment behind the chair of Jackeen. At a lull in the
      talk, she whispered a word in his ear. He looked up, nodded, and then
      followed her out into Doyers Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's this way,&rdquo; said Lulu. &ldquo;May's copped th' Doc from me, see! An' she's
      givin' you the cross, Jackeen. You ought to hand her out a good heatin'.
      She's over hittin' the pipe wit' th' Doc right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G'wan!&rdquo; came jealously from Jackeen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest! You come wit' me to number Nineteen, an' I'll show youse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jackeen paused as though weighing the pros and cons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go get Ricey,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;He's got a good nut, an' I'll put
      th' play up to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded Lulu, impatient in her desolation; &ldquo;but get a move
      on! I've wised you; an' now, if you're any good at all, you'll take May
      out of number Nineteen be th' mop. W'at license has she, or any other
      skirt for that matter, got to do me out of me Doc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last ended in a howl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Lulu in the midst of her complaints, Jackeen wheeled back into the
      Chatham Club for a word with Rice. Even during his absence, a change had
      come over the company. He found Rice, St. Louis Bill and Nannie Miller,
      holding anxious confab with a ratfaced person who had just come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Jackeen,&rdquo; said St. Louis Bill in an excited whisper, &ldquo;there's
      been a rap about that Savoy safe trick, an' th' bulls are right now
      lookin' for th' whole mob. They say it's us, too, who put that rube in the
      air over in Division Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' th' question is,&rdquo; broke in Nannie Miller, who was quick to act, &ldquo;do
      we stand pat, or do we do a lammister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's on'y one answer to that,&rdquo; said St. Louis Bill. &ldquo;For my end of it
      I'm goin' to lamm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jackeen had May and his heart troubles upon the back of his regard. Still
      he heard; and he arrived at a decision. He would run&mdash;yes; for flight
      was preferable to four stone walls. But he must have revenge&mdash;revenge
      upon the Doc and May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wit' th' bulls after me, an' me away, it 'ud be comin' too soft for 'em,&rdquo;
       thought Jackeen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at do youse say?&rdquo; asked St. Louis Bill, who was getting nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did youse get the woid?&rdquo; demanded Jackeen, turning upon Ratface. It
      was he who had brought the warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a stool for one of the bulls,&rdquo; replied Ratface, &ldquo;an' it's him tells
      me you blokes is wanted, see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're stoolin' for a Central Office cop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jackeen's manner was fraught with suspicion. &ldquo;How do we know you're givin'
      us th' correct dope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miller knows me,&rdquo; returned Ratface, &ldquo;an' so does Bill. They'll tell youse
      I'm a right guy. That stool thing is only a stall. I gets more out of the
      bull than he gets out of me. Sure; I give him a dead one now an' then,
      just be way of puttin' in a prop for meself. But not youse;&mdash;w'en
      it's any of me friends I puts 'em hep, see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you sign for this duck?&rdquo; demanded Jackeen of St. Louis Bill. &ldquo;He's a
      new one on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it from me, he's all right,&rdquo; said St. Louis Bill, decisively. &ldquo;Why,
      you ought to know him, Jackeen. He joined out wit' that mob of gons Goldie
      Louie took to Syracuse last fall. He's no farmer, neither; Ricey there
      ain't got nothin' on him as a tool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This endorsement of Ratface settled all doubt. Jackeen's mind was made up.
      Addressing the others, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fade's the woid! I'll meet youse over in Hoboken to-night at Beansey's.
      Better make th' ferry one at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at do youse want to wait till night for?&rdquo; asked Nannie Miller. &ldquo;Th'
      foist t'ing you know you'll get th' collar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' to take the chance, though,&rdquo; retorted Jackeen. &ldquo;It's some
      private business of me own. An' say&rdquo;&mdash;looking at Rice&mdash;&ldquo;I want a
      pal. Will youse stick, Ricey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Mike!&rdquo; said Rice, who had nerve and knew how to be loyal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was adjusted. Ratface went his way, to exercise his gifts of
      mendacity upon his Central Office principal, while the others scattered&mdash;all
      save Jackeen and Rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeen gave his faithful friend the story of his wrongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't have thought it of the Doc,&rdquo; was the pensive comment of Rice.
      He had exalted the Doc, because of his book learning, and groaned to see
      his idol fall. &ldquo;No, I wouldn't have guessed it of him! Of course, it's
      different wit' a doll. They'd double-cross their own mothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over in Catherine Street at number Nineteen the Doc was teaching May how
      to cook opium. The result fell below the Doc's elevated notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren't to be compared with Lulu,&rdquo; he complained, as he trimmed the
      peanut-oil lamp. &ldquo;All Chinatown couldn't show Lulu's equal for cooking
      hop. She had a genius for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doc took the needle from May, and cooked for himself. May looked
      discouraged and hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; said the Doc, dreamily, replying to the look of injury.
      &ldquo;You'll get it right in time, dear. Only, of course, you'll never quite
      equal Lulu; that would be impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doc twirled the little ball of opium in the flame of the lamp,
      watching the color as it changed. May looked on as upon the labors of a
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll smoke a couple of pipes,&rdquo; vouchsafed the Doc; &ldquo;then I must get to
      work on Nigger Mike's, teeth. Mike's a good fellow; they're all good
      fellows over at the Chatham Club,&rdquo; and the Doc sank back upon the pallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of someone in the hall. Then came those calmative four
      rings and four taps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Mike now,&rdquo; said the Doc, his eyes half closed. &ldquo;Let him in; I
      suppose he's come for his teeth. I'll have to give him a stand-off. Mike
      ought to have two sets of teeth. Then he could wear the one while I'm
      fixing the other. It's a good idea; I'll tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      May, warned by some instinct, opened the door but a timorous inch. What
      she saw did not inspire confidence, and she tried with all her little
      strength to close and bolt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late!
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was flung inward, and Jackeen, followed by Rice, entered the
      room. They paid no heed to the opium fumes; almost stifling they were, but
      Jackeen and Rice had long been used to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      May gazed at Jackeen like one planet-struck. The Doc, moveless on the
      pallet, hardly raised his opium-weighted lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a fine game I'm gettin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jackeen sneered out the words. The Doc pulled tranquilly at his pipe;
      while May stood voiceless, staring with scared eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd ought to peg a bullet into you,&rdquo; continued Jackeen, addressing May.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had drawn his heavy gun. May stood as if the sight of the weapon had
      frozen her. Jackeen brought it down on her temple. The Doc never moved.
      Peace&mdash;the peace of the poppy&mdash;was on his brow and in his heart.
      May fell to the floor, her face a-reek with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you've got yours!&rdquo; said Jackeen.
    </p>
    <p>
      May struggled unsteadily to her feet, and began groping for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ought to do youse till I get back,&rdquo; was Jackeen's good-by. &ldquo;You'll
      need a few stitches for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unruffled, untroubled, the Doc drew blandly at the mouthpiece of the pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeen surveyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; cried Rice; &ldquo;hand it to him, if you're goin' to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rice was becoming fretted. He hadn't Jackeen's sustaining interest.
      Besides, he was thinking of that word from the Central Office, and how
      much safer he would be with Beansey, on the Hoboken side of the Hudson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeen took a step nearer. The Doc smiled, eyes just showing through the
      dreamy lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn it loose!&rdquo; cried Rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gun exploded five times, and five bullets ploughed their way into the
      Doc's body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a cry, not a movement! The bland, pleased smile never left the sallow
      face. With his mouth to the pipestem, the Doc dreamed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the street, Jackeen and Rice passed Lulu. As they brushed by her, Rice
      fell back a pace and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He croaked th' Doc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lulu gave a gulping cry and hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Lulu?&rdquo; asked the Doc, his drug-uplifted soul untouched,
      untroubled by what had passed, and what would come. Still, he must have
      dimly known; for his next words, softly spoken, were: &ldquo;I'm sorry about
      Mike's teeth! Cook me a pill, dear; I want one last good smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      VII.&mdash;LEONI THE TROUBLE MAKER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a perfect
      day for a funeral. The thin October air had in it a half-chill, like the
      cutting edge of the coming winter, still six weeks away. The leaves, crisp
      and brown from early frosts, seemed to rustle approval of the mournful
      completeness of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florists' shops had been ransacked, greenhouses laid waste, the leading
      carriages were moving jungles of blossoms. It was magnificent, and as the
      procession wound its slow way into Calvary, the heart of the undertaker
      swelled with pride. Not that he was justified; the glory was the glory of
      Paper-Box Johnny, who stood back of all this gloomy splendor with his
      purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; was Paper-Box's word to the undertaker, &ldquo;I'm no piker, an'
      neither was Phil; so wade in wit' th' bridle off, an' make th' spiel same
      as if you was buryin' yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus exhorted, and knowing the solvency of Paper-Box, the undertaker had
      no more than broken even with his responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, Paper-Box became smitten of concern because he hadn't thought to
      hire a brass band. A brass band, he argued, breathing Chopin's Funeral
      March, would have given the business a last artistic touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd ought to have me nut caved in for forget-tin' it,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;but
      Phil bein' croaked like he was, got me rattled. I'm all in th' air right
      now! Me head won't be on straight ag'in for a mont'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the face of Paper-Box's self-condemnation, ones expert in those
      sorrowful matters of crape and immortelles, averred that the funeral was a
      credit to Casey, and regrets were expressed that the bullet in that dead
      hero's brain forbade his sitting up in the hearse and enjoying what was
      being done in his honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the first shovelful of earth awoke the hollow responses of the coffin,
      there occurred what story writers are fond of describing as a dramatic
      incident. As though the hollow coffin-note had been the dead voice of
      Casey calling, Dago Frankie knelt at the edge of the grave. Lifting his
      hands to heaven, he vowed to shed without mercy the blood of Goldie Louie
      and Brother Bill Orr, on sight. The vow was well received by the uncovered
      ring of mourners, and no one doubted but Casey's eternal slumbers would be
      the sounder for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning, she went by the name of Leoni; the same being
      subsequently lengthened, for good and sufficient reasons, to Leoni the
      Trouble Maker. As against this, however, her monaker, with the addition,
      &ldquo;Badger,&rdquo; as written upon her picture&mdash;gallery number 7409&mdash;to
      be found in that interesting art collection maintained by the police, was
      given as Mabel Grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leoni&mdash;according to Detective Biddinger of that city's Central Office&mdash;was
      born in Chicago, upon a spot not distant from the banks of the classic
      Drainage Canal. She came to New York, and began attracting police
      attention about eight years ago. In those days, radiant as a star, face of
      innocent beauty, her affections were given to an eminent pickpocket known
      and dreaded as Crazy Barry, and it was the dance she led that bird-headed
      person's unsettled destinies which won her the <i>nom de cour</i> of
      Trouble Maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate, perhaps, since it led to many grievous complications,
      that Leoni's love lacked every quality of the permanent. Hot, fierce, it
      resembled in its intensity a fire in a lumber yard. Also, like a fire in a
      lumber yard, it soon burned itself out. Her heart was as the heart of a
      wild goose, and wondrous migratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having loved Crazy Barry for a space, Leoni turned cool, then cold, then
      fell away from him altogether. At this, Crazy Barry, himself a volcano of
      sensibility, with none of Leoni's saving genius to grow cold, waxed wroth
      and chafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in this mixed and storm-tossed humor, he came upon Leoni in the
      company of a fellow gonoph known as McTafife. In testimony of what
      hell-pangs were tearing at his soul, Crazy Barry fell upon McTaffe, and
      cut him into red ribbons with a knife. He would have cut his throat, and
      spoke of doing so, but was prevailed upon to refrain by Kid Jacobs, who
      pointed out the electrocutionary inconveniences sure to follow such a
      ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'd slam youse in th' chair, sure!&rdquo; was the sober-headed way that
      Jacobs put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crazy Barry, one hand in McTafife's hair, had drawn the latter's head
      across his knee, the better to attend to the throat-cutting. Convinced,
      however, by the words of Jacobs, he let the head, throat all unslashed,
      fall heavily to the floor. After which, first wiping the blood from his
      knife on McTafife's coat&mdash;for he had an instinct to be neat&mdash;he
      lam-mistered for parts unknown, while McTafife was conveyed to the New
      York Hospital. This chanced in the Sixth Avenue temple of entertainment
      kept by the late Paddy the Pig.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once out of the hospital and into the street, McTafife and the fair Leoni
      found no trouble in being all the world to one another. Crazy Barry was a
      thing of the past and, since the Central Office dicks wanted him, likely
      to remain so.
    </p>
    <p>
      McTafife was of the swell mob. He worked with Goldie Louie, Fog-eye Howard
      and Brother Bill Orr. Ask any Central Office bull, half learned in his
      trade of crook-catcher, and he'll tell you that these names are of a
      pick-purse peerage. McTaffe himself was the stinger, and personally
      pinched the poke, or flimped the thimble, or sprung the prop, of whatever
      boob was being trimmed. The others, every one a star, were proud to act as
      his stalls; and that, more than any Central Office assurance, should show
      how near the top was McTaffe in gonoph estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every profession has its drawbacks, and that of picking pockets possesses
      several. For one irritating element, it is apt to take the practitioner
      out of town for weeks on end. Some sucker puts up a roar, perhaps, and
      excites the assiduities of the police; or there is a prize fight at Reno,
      or a World's Fair at St. Louis, or a political convention at Chicago, or a
      crowd-gathering tour by some notable like Mr. Roosevelt or Mr. Taft, which
      gives such promise of profit that it is not to be refused. Thus it befell
      that McTaffe, with his mob, was greatly abroad in the land, leaving Leoni
      deserted and alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once McTaffe remained away so long that it caused Leoni uneasiness, if not
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mack's fell for something,&rdquo; was the way she set forth her fears to Big
      Kitty: &ldquo;You can gamble he's in hock somewheres, or I'd have got the office
      from him by wire or letter long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When McTaffe at last came back, his face exhibited pain and defeat. He
      related how the mob had been caught in a jam in Chihuahua, and Goldie
      Louie lagged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of the fleet managed to make a getaway,&rdquo; said McTaffe, &ldquo;all but
      poor Goldie. Those Greasers have got him right, too; he's cinched to do a
      couple of spaces sure. When I reached El Paso, I slimmed me roll for five
      hundred bucks, an' hired him a mouthpiece. But what good is a mouthpiece
      when there ain't the shadow of a chance to spring him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Goldie got a rumble, did he?&rdquo; said Leoni, with a half sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tones were pensive to the verge of tears; since her love for Goldie
      was almost if not quite equal to the love she bore McTaffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldie Louie lay caged in the Chihuahua calaboose, and Sanky Dunn joined
      out with McTaffe and the others in his place. With forces thus
      reorganized, McTaffe took up the burdens of life again, and&mdash;here one
      day and gone the next&mdash;existence for himself and Leoni returned to
      old-time lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leoni met Casey. With smooth, dark, handsome face, Casey was the superior
      in looks of either McTaffe or Goldie Louie. Also, he had fame as a
      gun-fighter, and for a rock-like steadiness under fire. He was credited,
      too, by popular voice, with having been busy in the stirring, near
      vicinity of events, when divers gentlemen got bumped off. This had in it a
      fascination for Leoni, who&mdash;as have the ladies of every age and clime&mdash;dearly
      loved a warrior. Moreover, Casey had money, and, unlike those others, he
      was always on the job. This last was important to Leoni, who at any moment
      might find herself at issue with the powers, and Casey, because of his
      political position, could speak to the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leoni loved Casey, even as she had aforetime loved McTaffe, Goldie Louie
      and Crazy Barry. True, Casey owned a wife. But there arose nothing in his
      conduct to indicate it; and since he was too much of a gentleman to let it
      get in any one's way, Leoni herself was so generous as to treat it as a
      technicality.
    </p>
    <p>
      McTaffe and his mob returned from a losing expedition through the West.
      Leoni asked as to results.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; explained McTaffe, sulkily, &ldquo;th' trip was not only a waterhaul, but
      it leaves me on the nut for twelve hundred bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTaffe turned his pockets inside out, by way of corroboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus irritated because of that financial setback, McTaffe heard of
      Leoni's blushing nearness to Casey. It was the moment of all moments when
      he was least able to bear the blow with philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And McTaffe stormed. Going farther, and by way of corrective climax, he
      knocked Leoni down with a club. After which&mdash;according to
      eye-witnesses, who spoke without prejudice&mdash;he proceeded to beat her
      up for fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leoni told her adventures to Casey, and showed him what a harvest of
      bruises her love for him had garnered. Casey, who hadn't been born and
      brought up in Mulberry Bend to become a leading light of Gangland for
      nothing, took his gun and issued forth on the trail of McTaffe. McTaffe
      left town. Also, that he didn't take his mob with him proved that not
      graft, but fear of Casey, was the bug beneath the chip of his
      disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's sherried,&rdquo; Casey told Leoni, when that ill-used beauty asked if he
      had avenged her bruises. &ldquo;But he'll blow in ag'in; an' when he does I'll
      cook him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goldie Louie came up from Chihuahua, his yellow hair shot with gray, the
      prison pallor in the starved hollows of his cheeks. Mexicans are the most
      merciless of jailers. Fog-eye Howard, who was nothing if not a gossip,
      wised him up as to Leoni's love for Casey. In that connection Fog-eye
      related how McTaffe, having rebuked Leoni's heart wanderings with that
      convincing club, had now become a fugitive from Casey's gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having heard Fog-eye to the end, Goldie faithfully hunted up Leoni and
      wore out a second club on her himself. Again did Leoni creep to Casey with
      her woes and her wrongs, and again did that Knight of Mulberry Bend gird
      up his fierce loins to avenge her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us step rearward a pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Committee of Fourteen, in its uneasy purities, had caused Chick
      Tricker's Park Row license to be revoked, Tricker, seeking a livelihood,
      became the owner of the Stag in Twenty-eighth Street, just off Broadway.
      That license revocation had been a financial jolt, and now in new
      quarters, with Berlin Auggy, whom he had brought with him as partner, he
      was striving, in every way not likely to invoke police interference to
      re-establish his prostrate destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening next after the one upon which Goldie Louie, following
      the example of the vanished McTaffe, had expressed club-wise his
      disapproval of Leoni's love for Casey. The Stag was a riot of life and
      light and laughter; music and conversation and drink prevailed. In the
      rear room&mdash;fenced off from the bar by swinging doors&mdash;was Goldie
      Louie, together with Fog-eye Howard, Brother Bill Orr and Sanky Dunn.
      There, too, Whitey Dutch was entertaining certain of the choicest among
      the Five Pointers. Scattered here and there were Little Red, the Baltimore
      Rat, Louis Buck, Stager Bennett, Jack Cohalan, the Humble Dutchman, and
      others of renown in the grimy chivalry of crime. There were fair ones,
      too, and the silken sex found dulcet representation in such unchallenged
      belles as Pretty Agnes, Jew Yetta, Dutch Ida, and Anna Gold. True, an
      artist in womanly beauty might have found defects in each of these. And if
      so? Venus had a mole on her cheek, Helen a scar on her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tricker was not with his guests at the Stag that night. His father had
      been reported sick, and Tricker was in filial attendance at the Fourteenth
      Street bedside of his stricken sire. In his absence, Auggy took charge,
      and under his genial management beer flowed, coin came in, and all Stag
      things went moving merrily.

      Whitey Dutch, speaking to Stagger Bennett concerning Pioggi, aforetime put
      away in the Elmira Reformatory for the Coney Island killing of Cyclone
      Louie and Kid Twist, made quite a tale of how Pioggi, having served his
      time, had again shown up in town. Whitey mentioned, as a matter for
      general congratulation, that Pioggi's Elmira experience had not robbed him
      of his right to vote, as would have been the blighting case had he gone to
      Sing Sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing in that disfranchisement thing, anyhow,&rdquo; grumbled the
      Humble Dutchman, who sat sourly listening. &ldquo;I've been up th' river twict,
      an' I've voted a dozen times every election since. Them law-makin' stiffs
      is goin' to take your vote away! Say, that gives me a pain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Humble Dutchman got off the last in tones of supreme contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grouped around a table near the center, and under convoy of a Central
      Office representative who performed towards them in the triple rôle of
      guide, philosopher and friend, were gathered a half dozen Fifth Avenue
      males and females, all members in good standing of the Purple and Fine
      Linen Gang. Auggy, in the absence of Tricker, had received them
      graciously, pressed cigars and drinks upon them, declining the while their
      proffered money of the realm in a manner composite of suavity and princely
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's an honor, loides an' gents,&rdquo; said Auggy, &ldquo;merely to see your maps in
      the Stag at all. As for th' booze an' smokes, they're on th' house. Your
      dough don't go here, see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Purple and Fine Linen contingent called their visit slumming. If they
      could have heard what Auggy, despite his beaming smiles and royal
      liberality touching those refreshments, called both them and their visit,
      after they had left, it might have set their patrician ears afire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having done the Stag, and seen and heard and misunderstood things to their
      slumming souls' content, the Purple and Fine Linen Gang said goodbye. They
      must drop in&mdash;they explained&mdash;at the Haymarket, just around the
      corner in Sixth Avenue. Auggy invited them to come again, but was visibly
      relieved once they had gone their slumming way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid every minute some duck'd start something,&rdquo; said Auggy, &ldquo;an'
      of course if anything did break loose&mdash;any little t'ing, if it ain't
      no more than soakin' some dub in th' jaw&mdash;one of them Fift' Avenoo
      dames's 'ud be bound to t'row a fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; broke in Anna Gold resentfully; &ldquo;it's somethin' fierce th' way them
      high s'ciety fairies comes buttin' in on us. W'at do they think they're
      tryin' to give us, anyway? For th' price of a beer, I'd have snatched one
      of them baby-dolls baldheaded. I'd have nailed her be th' mop; an' w'en
      I'd got t'rough doin' stunts wit' her, she wouldn't have had to tell no
      one she'd been slummin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, forget it!&rdquo; interposed Auggy warningly. &ldquo;You go reachin' for any
      skirt's puffs round here, an' it'll be the hurry-up wagon at a gallop an'
      you for the cooler, Anna. The Stag's a quiet joint, an' that rough-house
      stuff don't go. Chick won't stand for no one to get hoited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Chick won't stand for no one to get hoited!&rdquo; retorted the acrid Anna,
      in mighty dudgeon. &ldquo;An' the Stag's a quiet joint! Why, it ain't six weeks
      since a guy pulls a cannister in this very room, an' shoots Joe Rocks full
      of holes. You helps take him to the hospital yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut out that Joe Rocks stuff,&rdquo; commanded Aug-gy, with vast heat, &ldquo;or
      you'll hit the street on your frizzes&mdash;don't make no mistake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Observing the stormy slant the talk was taking, Whitey Dutch
      diplomatically ordered beer, and thus put an end to debate. It was a move
      full of wisdom. Auggy was made nervous by the absence of Tricker, and Anna
      the Voluble, on many a field, had shown herself a lady of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the evening at the Stag thus went happily wearing towards the
      smaller hours, over in Twenty-ninth Street, a block away, the stuss game
      of Casey and Paper-Box Johnny was in full and profitable blast. Paper-Box
      himself was in active charge. Casey had for the moment abandoned business
      and every thought of it. Leoni had just informed him of those visitations
      at the hands of Goldie Louie, and set him to thinking on other things than
      cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' he says,&rdquo; concluded Leoni, preparing to go, &ldquo;after he's beat me half
      to death, 'now chase 'round an' tell your Dago friend, Casey, that my
      monaker ain't McTaffe, an' that if he starts to hand me anythin', I'll put
      him down in Bellevue for the count.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark face of Casey displayed both anger and resolution. He made
      neither threat nor comment, but his eyes were full of somber fires. Leoni
      departed with an avowed purpose of subjecting her injuries to the curative
      effects of arnica, while Casey continued to gloom and glower, drinking
      deeply the while to take the edge off his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Lemmy, a once promising prize-fighter of the welter-weight variety,
      showed up. Also, he had no more than settled to the drink, which Casey&mdash;whom
      the wrongs of his idolized Leoni could not render unmindful of the claims
      of hospitality&mdash;had ordered, when Jack Kenny and Charlie Young
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, not alive to the fatal importance of such news, spoke of the
      Stag, which he had left but the moment before, and of the presence there
      of Goldie Louie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;McTaffe's stalls, Fog-eye, Brother Bill an' Sanky Dunn, are lushin' wit'
      him,&rdquo; said Young. &ldquo;You know Sanky filled in wit' th' mob th' time Goldie
      gets settled in Mexico.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goldie Louie, only a block away, set the torch to Casey's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Dago Frankie?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dago Frankie was his nearest and most trusted friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's over in Sixt' Avenoo shootin' craps,&rdquo; replied Lemmy. &ldquo;Shall I go dig
      him up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't matter,&rdquo; said Casey, after a moment's thought. Then, getting up
      from his chair, he inquired, &ldquo;Have you guys got your cannons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure t'ing!&rdquo; came the general chorus, with a closer from Kenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got two,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A sport might get along wit'out a change of
      shoits in Noo York, but he never ought to be wit'out a change of guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at's on, Phil?&rdquo; asked Charlie Young, anxiously, as Casey pulled a
      magazine pistol, and carefully made sure that its stomach was full of
      cartridges; &ldquo;w'at's on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' over to the Stag,&rdquo; replied Casey. &ldquo;If you ducks'll listen
      you'll hear a dog howl in about a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll not only listen, but we'll go 'long,&rdquo; returned Young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lemmy and Kenny fell behind the ethers. &ldquo;W'at's th' muss?&rdquo; whispered
      Lemmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Leoni,&rdquo; explained Kenny guardedly. &ldquo;Goldie give her a wallop or two
      last night, an' Phil's goin' to do him for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Casey strode into the Stag, his bosom a storm-center for every black
      emotion. The sophisticated Auggy smelled instant trouble on him, as one
      smells fire in a house. Bending over the friendly shoulder of Whitey
      Dutch, Auggy spoke in a low tone of warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Phil Casey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an' t'ree of his bunch. It's apples to
      ashes he's gunnin' for Goldie. If Chick were here, now, he'd somehow put
      the smother on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him a call-down your own self,&rdquo; was Whitey's counsel. &ldquo;W'at with
      Chick's license bein' revoked in Park Row, an' Joe Rocks goin' to the
      hospital from here only a little over a mont' ago, the least bit of
      cannonadin' 's bound to put th' joint in Dutch all the way from
      headquarters to the State excise dubs in Albany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; returned Auggy, in great trouble of mind. &ldquo;If a gun so much
      as cracks once, it'll be th' fare-you-well of the Stag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, w'at do youse say?&rdquo; demanded the loyal Whitey. &ldquo;I'm wit' youse, an'
      I'm wit' Chick, an' I'm wit' Goldie. Give th' woid, an' I'll pull in a
      harness bull from off his beat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, none of that! Chick'd sooner burn the joint than call a cop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go give Casey a chin,&rdquo; said Whitey, &ldquo;meb-by I can hold him down. You
      put Goldie wise. Tell him to keep his lamps on Casey, an' if Casey reaches
      for his gatt to beat him to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Casey the decisive moved swiftly, however, and the proposed peace
      intervention failed for being too slow. Casey got a glimpse of Goldie
      through the separating screen doors. It was all he wanted. The next moment
      he had charged through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chairs crashed, tables were overthrown, women shrieked and men cursed.
      Twenty guns were out. Casey fired six times at Goldie Louie, and six times
      missed that lucky meddler with other people's pocket-books. Not that
      Casey's efforts were altogether thrown away. His first bullet lodged in
      the stomach of Fog-eye, while his third broke the arm of Brother Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitey Dutch reached Casey as the latter began his artillery practice, and
      sought by word and moderate force to induce a truce. Losing patience,
      however, Whitey, as Casey fired his final shot, pulled his own gun and put
      a bullet through and through that berserk's head. As Casey fell forward, a
      second bullet&mdash;coming from anywhere&mdash;buried itself in his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord, I've croaked Phil!&rdquo; was the exclamation of Whitey, addressed
      to no one in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were Whitey's last words; some one shoved the muzzle of a gun against
      his temple, and he fell by the side of Casey.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sure list of dead and wounded for that evening's battle of the Stag
      will ever be compiled. The guests scattered like a flock of blackbirds.
      Some fled limping and groaning, others nursing an injured arm, while three
      or four, too badly hurt to travel, were dragged into nooks of safety by
      friends who'd come through untouched. There was blood to the east, blood
      to the west, on the Twenty-eighth Street pavements, and a wounded
      gentleman was picked up in Broadway, two blocks away. The wounded one,
      full of a fine prudence and adhering strictly to gang teachings, declared
      that the bullet which had struck him was a bullet of mystery. Also, he
      gave his word of honor that, personally, he had never once heard of the
      Stag.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the police reached the field of battle&mdash;wearing the ill-used
      airs of folk who had been unwarrantably disturbed&mdash;they found Casey
      and Whitey Dutch dead on the floor, and Fog-eye groaning in a corner. To
      these&mdash;counting the injured Brother Bill and the prudent one picked
      up in Broadway, finally identified as Sanky Dunn&mdash;rumor added two
      dead and eleven wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leoni?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Central Office dicks who met that lamp of loveliness the other evening
      in Broadway reported her as in abundant spirits, and more beautiful than
      ever. She had received a letter from McTaffe, she said, who sent his love,
      and her eyes shone like twin stars because of the joy she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mack always had a good heart,&rdquo; said Leoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paper-Box Johnny&mdash;all in tears&mdash;bore sorrowful word of her loss
      to Mrs. Casey, calling that matron from her slumbers to receive it.
      Paper-Box managed delicately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's time to dig up black!&rdquo; sobbed Paper-Box; &ldquo;they've copped Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copped Phil?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Casey, sleepily. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a slab in the morgue. Youse'd better chase yourself over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Casey, making ready to go back to bed, &ldquo;I will
      after awhile.&rdquo;

      VIII. THE WAGES OF THE SNITCH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">K</span>nowledge is power,
      and power is a good thing, as you yourself well know. Since Eve opened the
      way, and she and Adam paid the price&mdash;a high one, I sometimes think&mdash;you
      are entitled to every kind of knowledge. Also, you are entitled to all
      that you can get.
    </p>
    <p>
      But having acquired knowledge, you are not entitled to peddle it out in
      secret to Central Office bulls, at a cost of liberty and often life to
      other men. When you do that you are a snitch, and have thrown away your
      right to live. Anyone is free to kill you out of hand, having regard only
      to his own safety. For such is the common law of Gangland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me ladle out a cautionary spoonful.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you go about accumulating knowledge, you should fix your eye upon one
      or two great truths. You must never forget that when you are close enough
      to see a man you are close enough to be seen. It is likewise foolish,
      weakly foolish, to assume that you are the only gas jet in the chandelier,
      the only pebble on the beach, or possess the only kodak throughout the
      entire length of the boardwalk. Bear ever in mind that while you are
      getting the picture of some other fellow, he in all human chance is
      snapping yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last is not so much by virtue of any law of Gangland as by a law of
      nature. Its purpose is to preserve that equilibrium, wanting which, the
      universe itself would slip into chaos and the music of the spheres become
      but the rawest tuning of the elemental instruments. The stars would no
      longer sing together, but shriek together, and space itself would be
      driven to stop its ears. Folk who fail to carry these grave matters upon
      the constant shoulder of their regard, get into trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Gouverneur hospital, where he died, the register gave his name as
      &ldquo;Samuel Wendell,&rdquo; and let it go at that. The Central Office, which finds
      its profit in amplification, said, &ldquo;Samuel Wendell, <i>alias</i> Kid
      Unger, <i>alias</i> the Ghost,&rdquo; and further identified him as &ldquo;brother to
      Johnny the Mock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samuel Wendell, <i>alias</i> Kid Unger, <i>alias</i> the Ghost, brother to
      Johnny the Mock, was not the original Ghost. Until less than two years ago
      the title was honorably worn by Mashier, who got twenty spaces for a night
      trick he turned in Brooklyn. Since Mashier could not use the name in Sing
      Sing, Wendell, <i>alias</i> Kid Unger, brother to Johnny the Mock, adopted
      it for his own. It fitted well with his midnight methods and noiseless,
      gliding, skulking ways. Moreover, since it was upon his own sly rap to the
      bulls, who made the collar, that Mashier got pinched, he may have felt
      himself entitled to the name as part of his reward. The Indian scalps his
      victim, and upon a similar principle Wendell, <i>alias</i> Unger, brother
      to Johnny the Mock, when Mashier was handed that breath-taking twenty
      years, may have decided to call himself the Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will never be precisely known how and why and by whose hand the Ghost
      was killed, although it is common opinion that Pretty Agnes had much to do
      with it. Also, common opinion is more often right than many might believe.
      In view of that possible connection with the bumping off of the Ghost,
      Pretty Agnes is worth a word. She could not have been called old. When
      upon a certain Saturday evening, not remote, she stepped into Jack
      Sirocco's in Chatham Square, her years counted fewer than nineteen. Still,
      she had seen a good deal&mdash;or a bad deal&mdash;whichever you prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Agnes' father, a longshoreman, had found his bread along the docks.
      None better ever-shaped for a boss stevedore, or trotted up a gangplank
      with a 280-pound sack of sugar on his back. One day he fell between the
      side of a moored ship and the stringpiece of the wharf; and the ship,
      being at that moment ground against the wharf by the swell from a passing
      steamer, he was crushed. Those who looked on called him a fool for having
      been killed in so poor a way. He was too dead to resent the criticism, and
      after that his widow, the mother of Pretty Agnes, took in washing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother washed, and Pretty Agnes carried home the clothes. This went on
      for three years. One wind-blown afternoon, as the mother was hanging out
      clothes on the roof&mdash;a high one&mdash;and refreshing her energies
      with intermittent gin from the bottle of her neighbor, the generous Mrs.
      Callahan, she stepped backward down an airshaft. She struck the flags ten
      stories below, and left Pretty Agnes to look out for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking out for herself, Pretty Agnes worked in a sweatshop in Division
      Street. Here she made three dollars a week and needed five. The sweatshop
      owner&mdash;for she was a dream of loveliness, with a fog of blue-black
      hair and deep brown eyes&mdash;offered to make up the lacking two, and was
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round, ripe, willowy, Pretty Agnes graduated from the Division Street
      sweatshop to a store in Twenty-third Street. There she served as a cloak
      model, making fourteen dollars a week while needing twenty. The manager of
      the cloak store was as generous as had been the owner of the sweatshop,
      and benevolently made up the absent six.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Pretty Agnes was lovelier than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy. Also, it has the same effect
      on Jill. Pretty Agnes&mdash;she had a trunkful of good clothes and yearned
      to show them&mdash;went three nights a week to one of those dancing
      academies wherewith the East Side was and is rife. As she danced she met
      Indian Louie, and lost no time in loving him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having advantage of her love, that seeker after doubtful dollars showed
      Pretty Agnes where and how she could make more money than would come to
      her as a cloak model in any Twenty-third Street store. Besides, he
      jealously disapproved of the benevolent manager, though, all things
      considered, it is hard to say why.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Agnes, who had grown weary of the manager and to whom Louie's word
      was law, threw over both the manager and her cloak-model position. After
      which she walked the streets for Louie&mdash;as likewise did Mollie Squint&mdash;and,
      since he often beat her, continued to love him from the bottom of her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Pretty Agnes and Mollie Squint, Louie lived sumptuously. Nor could
      they themselves be said to have altogether suffered; for each knew how to
      lick her fingers as a good cook should. Perhaps Louie was aware that his
      darlings held out on him, but regarded it as just an investment. He must
      have known that to dress well stood first among the demands of their
      difficult profession, which was ancient and had been honorable, albeit in
      latter days ill spoken of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louie died, and was mourned roundly by Pretty Agnes for eight weeks. Then
      she gave her love to Sammy Hart, who was out-on-the-safe. Charlie Lennard,
      <i>alias</i> Big Head, worked pal to Sammy Hart, and the Ghost went with
      them as outside man and to help in carrying the tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commonly Sammy and Big Head tackled only inferior safes, in cracking which
      nothing nobler nor more recondite than a can-opener was demanded. Now and
      then, however, when a first-class box had to be blown and soup was an
      absolute requirement, the Ghost came in exceeding handy. No yegg who ever
      swung under and traveled from town to town without a ticket, knew better
      than did the Ghost how to make soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soup-making process, while ticklish, ought to be worth reading about.
      A cake of dynamite is placed in the cold bottom of a kettle. Warm water is
      added, and the kettle set a-simmer over a benzine lamp. As the water
      heats, the dynamite melts into oil, and the oil&mdash;being lighter&mdash;rises
      to the top of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oil is drawn softly off with a syringe, and as softly discharged into
      a bottle half filled with alcohol. The alcohol is to prevent explosion by
      jarring. Soup, half oil, half alcohol, can be fired with a fuse, but will
      sustain quite a jolt without resenting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not true in an elder day, before our box workers discovered that
      golden alcoholic secret. There was a yegg once who was half in, half out,
      of the window of a P. O. Pie had the bottle of soup in his hip pocket. The
      sash fell, struck the consignment of hip-pocket soup, and all that was
      found of the yegg were the soles of his shoes. Nothing so disconcerting
      would have happened had the Ghost made the soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ghost, while believed in by Big Head and Sammy, was distrusted by
      Pretty Agnes. She distrusted him because of his bad repute as a snitch.
      She called Sammy's attention to what tales were abroad to the black effect
      that the Ghost was a copper in his mildewed soul, and one time and another
      had served stoolpigeon to many dicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sammy took no stock in these reports, and told Pretty Agnes so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' Ghost's all right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he's been wit' me an' Big Head when we
      toins off twenty joints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may go wit' you,&rdquo; retorted Pretty Agnes, &ldquo;for twenty more tricks, an'
      never rap. But mark me woids, Sammy; in th' end he'll make a present of
      youse to th' bulls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sammy only laughed, holding that the feminine intelligence, while
      suspicious, was not a strong intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sammy, when he had ceased laughing, &ldquo;if th' Ghost does
      double-cross me, w'at'll youse do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at'll I do? As sure as my monaker is Pretty Agnes, I'll have him
      cooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good goil!&rdquo; said Sammy Hart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gangland discusses things social, commercial, political, and freely forms
      and gives opinions. From a panic in Wall Street to the making of a
      President, nothing comes or goes uncommented upon and unticketed in
      Gangland. Even the fashions are threshed out, and sage judgments rendered
      concerning frocks and hats and all the latest hints from Paris. This you
      can test for yourself, on any evening, at such hubs of popular interest as
      Sirocco's, Tony's, Jimmy Kelly's or the Chatham Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sirocco's was a-swarm with life that Saturday evening when Pretty Agnes
      dropped in so casually. At old Jimmy's table they were considering the
      steel trust investigation, then proceeding&mdash;ex-President Roosevelt
      had that day testified&mdash;and old Jimmy and the Irish Wop voiced their
      views, and gave their feelings vent. Across at Slimmy's the dread doings
      of a brace of fair ones, who had excited Coney Island by descending upon
      that lively suburb in harem skirts, was under discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of the steel trust investigation and its developments, old Jimmy
      was unbelting after this wise. Said he, bringing down his hairy fist with
      a whack that startled every beer glass on the table into an upward jump of
      full three inches:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' more I read of th' doin's of them rich guys, th' more I begin to
      think that th' makin' of a mutt lurks in every million dollars. Say, Wop,
      they don't know how to pick up a hand an' play it, after it's been dealt
      'em. Take 'em off Wall Street an' mix 'em up wit' anything except stocks,
      an' they can't tell a fire plug from a song an' dance soubrette. If some
      ordinary skate was to go crabbin' his own personal game th' way they do
      theirs, th' next you'd hear that stew would be in Blooming-dale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phwat's eatin' yez now, Jimmy?&rdquo; inquired the Wop, carelessly. &ldquo;Is it that
      steel trusht thing th' pa-a-apers is so full of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That an' th' way Morgan an' th' balance of that fur-lined push fall over
      themselves. Th' big thing they're shy on is diplomacy. When it comes to
      diplomacy, they're a lot of dead ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' phwat's diplom'cy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wop didn't like big words; his feeling was to first question, then
      resent them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phwat's diplom'cy?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diplomacy,&rdquo; said old Jimmy, &ldquo;is any cunnin' move that lands th' trick.
      You wake up an' hear a noise; an' you think it's some porch-climber, like
      th' Nailer here, turnin' off th' joint. At that, not knowin' but he's
      framed up with a gun, you don't feel like goin' to th' mat with him. What
      do you do? Well, you use diplomacy. You tosses mebby a dumbbell over th'
      bannisters, an' lets it go bumpin' along from step to step, makin' more
      row than some geezer failin' down stairs with a kitchen stove. Th' racket
      throws a scare into th' Nailer, an' he beats it, see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' that's diplom'cy!&rdquo; said the Wop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also, it's exactly what them Wall Streeters ain't got. Look at th' way
      they're always fightin' Roosevelt. For twenty-five years they've been
      roustin' Teddy; an' for twenty-five years they've done nothin' but keep
      him on th' map. When Teddy was in Mulberry Street th' Tammany ducks gets
      along with him as peaceful as a basketful of pups. Diplomacy does it;
      that, an' payin' strict attention to Teddy's blind side. 'What's th' use
      of kickin' in th' gate,' says they, 'when we knows where a picket's off
      th' fence?' You remember Big Florrie Sullivan puttin' young Brady on th'
      Force? Teddy's in Mulberry Street then. Do you think Big Florrie goes
      queerin' th' chances, be tellin' Teddy how Brady passes th' cush box in
      Father Curry's church? Not on your life! It wouldn't have been diplomacy;
      Teddy wouldn't have paid no attention. Big Florrie gets in his work like
      this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Say, Commish,' he says, 'I sees th' fight of my life last night.
      Nineteen rounds to a knockout! It's a left hook to th' jaw does it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No!' Teddy says, lightin' up like Chinatown on th' night of a Chink
      festival; 'you int'rest me! Pull up a stool,' says he, 'an' put your feet
      on th' desk. There; now you're comfortable, go on about th' fight. Who
      were they?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A lad from my district named Brady,' says Big Florry, 'an' a
      dock-walloper from Williamsburg. You ought to have seen it, Commish! Oh,
      Brady's th' goods! Pie's th' lad to go th' route! He's all over that
      Williamsburg duffer like a cat over a shed roof! He went 'round him like a
      cooper 'round a barrel!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big Florrie runs on like that, using diplomacy, an' two weeks later
      Brady's thumpin' a beat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye're r-r-right, Jimmy,&rdquo; said the Wop, after a pause which smelled of
      wisdom; &ldquo;I agrees wit' yez. Morgan, Perkins, Schwab an' thim rich omadauns
      is th' bum lot. Now I think av it, too, Fatty Walsh minchons that wor-r-rd
      diplom'cy to me long ago. Yez knew Fatty, Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fatty an' me was twins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fatty's th' foine la-a-ad; on'y now he's dead&mdash;Mary resht him! Th'
      time I'm in th' Tombs for bouncin' th' brick off th' head av that
      Orangeman, who's whistlin' th' Battle av th' Boyne to see how long I can
      shtand it, Fatty's th' warden; an' say, he made th' place home to me. He's
      talkin', Fatty is, wan day about Mayor Hughey Grant, an' it's then he
      shpeaks av diplom'cy. He says Hughey didn't have anny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you believe it!&rdquo; interrupted old Jimmy; &ldquo;Fatty had Hughey down
      wrong. When it comes to diplomacy, Hughey could suck an egg an' never chip
      th' shell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a special case loike. Fatty's dishtrict, d'yez see, has nothin' in
      it but Eyetalians. Wan day they'r makin' ready to cilibrate somethin'.
      Fatty's in it, av course, bein' leader, an' he chases down to th' City
      Hall an' wins out a permit for th' Dago parade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's Hughey got to do with that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lishten! It shtrikes Hughey, him bein' Mayor, it'll be th' dead wise
      play, when Fatty marches by wit' his Guineas, to give them th' gay,
      encouragin' face. Hughey thinks Fatty an' his pushcart la-a-ads is
      cilibratin' some Dago Saint Patrick's day, d'yez see. It's there Fatty
      claims that Hughey shows no diplom'cy; he'd ought to have ashked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asked what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm comin' to it. Fatty knows nothin' about phwat's on Hughey's chest.
      His first tip is when he sees Hughey, an' th' balance av th' Tammany
      administration cocked up in a hand-me-down grandstand they've faked
      together in City Hall Park. Fatty pipes 'em, as he an' his Black Hand
      bunch comes rowlin' along down Broadway, an' th' sight av that grandshtand
      full av harps, Hughey at th' head, almosht gives him heart failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fatty halts his Eyetalians, sets them to ma-a-arkin' toime, an' comes
      sprintin' an' puffin' on ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Do a sneak!' he cries, when he comes near enough to pass th' wor-r-rd.
      'Mother above! don't yez know phwat these wops av mine is cilibratin'?
      It's chasin' th' pope out av Rome. Duck, I tell yez, duck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure; Hughiy an' th' rist av th' gang took it on th' run. Fatty could
      ma-a-arch all right, because there's nobody but blackhanders in his
      dish-trict. But wit' Hughey an' th' others it's different. They might have
      got his grace, th' archbishop, afther thim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin' back to Teddy,&rdquo; observed old Jimmy, as he called for beer, &ldquo;them
      rich lobsters is always stirrin' him up. An' they always gets th' worst of
      it. They've never brought home th' bacon yet. Tie's put one over on 'em
      every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yez can gamble that Tiddy's th' la-a-ad that can fight!&rdquo; cried the Wop in
      tones of glee; &ldquo;he's th' baby that's always lookin' f'r an argument!&rdquo; Then
      in a burst, both rapturous and irrelevant: &ldquo;tie's th' idol av th' criminal
      illimint!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think that's ag'inst him,&rdquo; interjected the Nailer, defensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor me neither,&rdquo; said old Jimmy. &ldquo;When it comes down to tacks, who's
      quicker wit' th' applaudin' mitt at sight of an honest man than th'
      crim'nal element?&mdash;only so he ain't bumpin' into their graft. Who is
      it hisses th' villyun in th' play till you can hear him in Hoboken? Ain't
      it some dub just off the Island? Once a Blind Tom show is at Minor's, an'
      a souse in th' gallery is so carried away be grief at th' death of Little
      Eva, he falls down two flights of stairs. I gets a flash at him as they
      tosses him into th' ambulance, an' I hopes to join th' church if it ain't
      a murderer I asks Judge Battery Dan to put away on Blackwell's for beatin'
      up his own little girl till she can't get into her frock. Wall Streeters
      an' college professors, when it comes to endorsin' an honest man, can't
      take no medals off th' crim'nal element.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phwy has Morgan an' th' rist av thim Wall Street geeks got it in f'r
      Tiddy?&rdquo; queried the Wop. &ldquo;Phwat's he done to 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'; only they claims it ain't larceny if you steal more'n a hundred
      thousand dollars, an' Teddy won't stand for a limit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that's phwat they're in a clinch about, then I'm for Tiddy,&rdquo; declared
      the Wop. &ldquo;Ain't it him, too, that says th' only difference bechune a rich
      man an' a poor man is at th' bank? More power to him!&mdash;why not? Would
      this beer be annythin' but beer, if it came through a spigot av go-o-old,
      from a keg av silver, an' th' bar-boy had used a dia-mond-shtudded
      bung-starter in tappin' it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over at Slimmy's table, where the weaker sex predominated, the talk was
      along lighter lines. Mollie Squint spoke in condemnation of those harem
      skirts at Coney Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do youse think,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;of them she-scouts showin' up at Luna
      Park in harem skirts? Coarse work that&mdash;very coarse. It goes to prove
      how some frails ain't more'n half baked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does a dame go to th' front in such togs?&rdquo; asked Slimmy disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she's stuck on herself,&rdquo; said the Nailer, who had drifted over
      from old Jimmy and the Wop, where the talk was growing too heavy for him;
      &ldquo;an' besides, it's an easy way of gettin' th' spot-light. Take anything
      like this harem skirt stunt, an' oodles of crazy Mollies'll fall for it.
      Youse can't hand it out too raw! So if it's goin' to stir things up, an'
      draw attention, they're Johnny-at-the-rat-hole every time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ladies,&rdquo; remarked Jew Yetta, like a complacent Portia giving judgment,
      &ldquo;certainly do like to be present at th' ball game! An' if we can't beat
      th' gate&mdash;can't heel in&mdash;we'll climb th' fence. Likewise, we're
      right there whenever it's th' latest thing. Especially, if we've got a
      face that'd stop traffic in th' street. Do youse remember&rdquo;&mdash;this to
      Anna Gold&mdash;&ldquo;when bicycles is new, how a lot of old iron-bound
      fairies, wit' maps that'd give youse a fit of sickness, never wastes a
      moment in wheelin' to th' front?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I remember when bicycles is new?&rdquo; retorted Anna Gold, resentfully.
      &ldquo;How old do youse think I be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' Nailer's right,&rdquo; said Slimmy, cutting skilfully in with a view to
      keeping the peace. &ldquo;Th' reason why them dames breaks in on bicycles, an'
      other new deals, is because it attracts attention; an' attractin'
      attention is their notion of bein' great. Which shows that they don't know
      th' difference between bein' famous an' bein' notorious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slimmy, having thus declared himself, looked as wise as a treeful of owls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, w'at is th' difference?&rdquo; demanded Anna Gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's th' difference between fame an' notoriety?&rdquo; repeated Slimmy, brow
      lofty, manner high. &ldquo;It's th' difference, Goldie, between havin' your
      picture took at th' joint of a respectable photographer, an' bein' mugged
      be th' coppers at th' Central Office. As to harem skirts, however, I'm
      like Mollie there. Gen'rally speakin', I strings wit' th' loidies; but
      when they springs a make-up like them harem skirts, I pack in. Harem
      skirts is where I get off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Big Kitty, who while speaking little spoke always to the
      point, &ldquo;youse souses understands that them dolls who shakes up Coney has
      an ace buried. They're simply a brace of roof-gardeners framin' up a
      little ink. I s'pose they fig-gered they'd make a hit. Did they?&rdquo;&mdash;this
      was in reply to Mollie Squint, who had asked the question. &ldquo;Well, if
      becomin' th' reason why th' bull on post rings in a riot call, an' brings
      out th' resoives, is your idee of a hit, Mollie, them dames is certainly
      th' big scream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them harem skirts won't do!&rdquo; observed the Nailer, firmly; &ldquo;youse hear me,
      they won't do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' that goes f'r merry widdy hats, too,&rdquo; called out the Wop, from across
      the room. &ldquo;Only yister-day a big fat baby rounds a corner on me, an' bang!
      she ketches me in th' lamp wit' th' edge av her merry widdy. On the livil,
      I thought it was a cross-cut saw! She came near bloindin' me f'r loife. As
      I side-steps, a rooshter's tail that's sproutin' out av th' roof, puts me
      other optic on th' blink. I couldn't have seen a shell av beer, even if
      Jimmy here was payin' fer it. Harem skirts is bad; but th' real minace is
      merry widdys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought them lids was called in,&rdquo; remarked Slimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they was,&rdquo; returned the Wop, &ldquo;they got bailed out ag'in. Th' one I'm
      nailed wit' is half as big as Betmont Pa-a-ark. Youse could 've raced a
      field av two-year olds on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked the Nailer, resignedly, &ldquo;it's th' fashion, an' it's up to
      us, I s'pose, to stand it. That or get off the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who invints th' fashions?&rdquo; and here the Wop appealed to the deep
      experience of old Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Jimmy&mdash;his pension had just been paid&mdash;motioned to the
      waiter to again take the orders all 'round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' French. They're the laddy-bucks that shoves 'em from shore. Say
      'Fashion!' an' bing! th' French is on th' job, givin' orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thim Frinch 're th' great la-a-ads,&rdquo; commented the Wop, admiringly.
      &ldquo;There's a felly on'y this mornin' tellin' me they can cook shnails so's
      they're almosht good to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell that bug to guess ag'in, Wop,&rdquo; said Mollie Squint. &ldquo;Snails is never
      good to eat. As far as them French are concerned, however, I go wit' old
      Jimmy. They're a hot proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack Sirocco had been walking up and down, his manner full of uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong, Jack?&rdquo; at last asked old Jimmy, who had observed that
      proprietor's anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sirocco explained that divers gimlet-eyed gentlemen, who he believed were
      emissaries of an antivice society, had been in the place for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They only now screwed out,&rdquo; continued Sirocco. Then, dolefully: &ldquo;It'd be
      about my luck, just as I'm beginnin' to get a little piece of change for
      myself, to have some of them virchoo-toutin' ginks hand me a wallop. I
      wonder w'at good it does 'em to be always tryin' to knock th' block off
      somebody. I ain't got nothin' ag'inst virchoo. Vir-choo's all right in its
      place. But so is vice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Jimmy's philosophy began manoeuvring for the high ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This vice and virtue thing makes me tired,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there's too much of
      it. Also, there's plenty to be said both ways. Th' big trouble wit' them
      anti-vice dubs is that they're all th' time connin' themselves. They feel
      moral when it's merely dyspepsia; they think they're virchous when they're
      only sick. In th' end, too, virchoo always falls down. Virchoo never puts
      a real crimp in vice yet. Virchoo's a sprinter; an' for one hundred yards

      oblige. Virchoo wants two months in th' country every summer; vice never

    <p>
      The Wop loudly cheered old Jimmy's views. Sirocco, however, continued
      gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said the latter with a sigh, &ldquo;I can feel it that them anti-vice
      guys has put th' high-sign on me. They'll never rest now until they've got
      me number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Agnes, on comin' in, had taken a corner table by herself. She
      heard, but did not join in the talk. She even left untouched the glass of
      beer, which, at a word from old Jimmy, a waiter had placed before her.
      Silent and sad, with an expression which spoke of trouble present or
      trouble on its way, she sat staring into smoky space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at's wrong wit' her?&rdquo; whispered Slimmy, who, high-strung and sensitive,
      could be worked upon by another's troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't youse ask her?&rdquo; said Big Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slimmy shook a doubtful head. &ldquo;She ain't got no use for me,&rdquo; he explained,
      &ldquo;since that trouble wit' Indian Louie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sure couldn't expect you an' th' Grabber,&rdquo; remarked Anna Gold, quite
      scandalized at the thought of such unfairness, &ldquo;to lay dead, while Louie
      does you out of all that dough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's th' rent,&rdquo; said Jew Yetta. She had been canvassing Pretty Agnes out
      of the corners of her eyes. &ldquo;I know that look from me own experience. She
      can't come across for the flat, an' some bum of an agent has handed her a
      notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothin' in that,&rdquo; declared Mollie Squint. &ldquo;She could touch me for
      th' rent, an' she's hep to it.&rdquo; Then, in reproof of the questioning looks
      of Anna Gold: &ldquo;Sure; both me an' Agnes was stuck on Indian Louie, but w'at
      of that? Louie's gone; an' besides, I never blames her. It's me who's th'
      butt-in; Agnes sees Louie first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Youse 're wrong, Yetta,&rdquo; spoke up the Nailer, confidently. &ldquo;Agnes ain't
      worryin' about cush. There ain't a better producer anywhere than Sammy
      Hart. No one ever sees Sammy wit'out a roll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Nailer lounged across to Pretty Agnes; Mollie Squint, whose heart was
      kindly, followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'y don't youse lap up your suds?&rdquo; queried the Nailer, pointing to the
      beer. Without waiting for a return, he continued, &ldquo;Where's Sammy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; returned Pretty Agnes, her manner half desperate.
      &ldquo;Nailer, I'm simply fretted batty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at's gone crooked, dear?&rdquo; asked Mollie Squint, soothingly. &ldquo;Youse ain't
      been puttin' on th' mitts wit' Sammy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Pretty Agnes, the tears beginning to flow; &ldquo;me an' Sammy's
      all right. On'y he won't listen!&rdquo; Then suddenly pointing with her finger,
      she exclaimed; &ldquo;There! It's him I'm worryin' about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Nailer and Mollie Squint glanced in the direction indicated by Pretty
      Agnes. The Ghost had just come in and was sidling into a chair. It must be
      admitted that there was much in his appearance to dislike. His lips were
      loose, his eyes half closed and sleepy, while his chin was catlike,
      retreating, unbased. In figure he was undersized, slope-shouldered,
      slouching. When he spoke, his voice drawled, and the mumbled words fell
      half-formed from the slack angles of his mouth. He was an eel&mdash;a
      human eel&mdash;slippery, slimy, hard to locate, harder still to hold. To
      find him you would have to draw off all the water in the pond, and then
      poke about in the ooze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's him that's frettin' me,&rdquo; repeated Pretty Agnes. &ldquo;He's got me wild!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Nailer donned an expression, cynical and incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at's this?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;W'y Agnes, youse ain't soft on that mutt, be
      youse? Say, youse must be gettin' balmy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't that,&rdquo; returned Pretty Agnes, indignantly. &ldquo;Do youse think I'd
      fall for such a chromo? I'd be bughouse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bughouse wouldn't half tell it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mollie Squint fervently.
      &ldquo;Him?&rdquo;&mdash;nodding towards the Ghost. &ldquo;W'y he's woise'n a wet dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned the puzzled Nailer, who with little imagination, owned
      still less of sentimental breadth, &ldquo;if youse ain't stuck on him, how's he
      managin' to fret youse? Show me, an' I'll take a punch at his lamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Punchin' wouldn't do no good,&rdquo; replied Pretty Agnes, resignedly. &ldquo;This is
      how it stands. Sammy an' Big Head's gettin' ready to do a <i>schlam</i>
      job. They've let th' Ghost join out wit' 'em, an' I know he's goin' to
      give 'em up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Nailer looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless youse've got somethin' on him, Agnes.&rdquo; he remonstrated, &ldquo;you
      oughtn't to make a squawk like that. How do youse know he's goin' to rap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cause he always raps,&rdquo; she cried fiercely. &ldquo;Where's Mashier? Where's
      Marky Price? Where's Skinny Goodstein? Up th' river!&mdash;every mother's
      son of 'em! An' all his pals, once; every one! He's filled in wit' th'
      best boys that ever cracked a bin. An' every one of 'em's doin' their
      bits, while he's here drinkin' beer. I tell youse th' Ghost's a snitch!
      Youse can see 'Copper' written on his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I t'ought so,&rdquo; growled the Nailer, an evil shine in his beady eyes,
      &ldquo;I'd croak him right here.&rdquo; Then, as offering a solution: &ldquo;If youse 're so
      sure he's a stool, w'y don't youse tail him an' see if he makes a meet
      wit' any bulls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tail nothin'!&rdquo; scoffed Pretty Agnes, bitterly; &ldquo;me mind's made up. All
      I'll do is wait. If Sammy falls, it'll be th' Ghost's last rap. I know a
      party who's crazy gone on me. For two weeks I've been handin' him th' ice
      pitcher. All I has to do is soften up a little, an' he'll cook th' Ghost
      th' minute I says th' woid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretty Agnes, as though the sight of the Ghost were too much for her
      feelings, left the place. The Ghost himself, appeared uneasy, and didn't
      remain long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nailer turned soberly to Mollie Squint. &ldquo;Do youse t'ink,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;there's anythin' in that crack of Agnes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search me!&rdquo; returned Mollie Squint, conservatively. &ldquo;I ain't sayin' a
      woid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's funny about youse skoits,&rdquo; remarked the Nailer, his manner an
      imitation of old Jimmy's. &ldquo;Here's Agnes talkin' of havin' th' Ghost
      trimmed in case he tips off Sammy to th' dicks, an' yet when Slimmy an'
      th' Grabber puts Indian Louie over th' jump, neither Agnes nor you ever so
      much as yelps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand,&rdquo; said Mollie Squint, tolerantly. &ldquo;Sammy's nice to
      Agnes. Louie? Th' best he ever hands us is to sting us for our rolls, an'
      then go blow 'em on that blonde. There's a big difference, Nailer, if
      youse could only see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the Nailer, who boasted a heart untouched, &ldquo;all I can say
      is youse dolls are too many for me! You've got me wingin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Midnight!
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatre of operations was a cigar store, in Canal Street near the
      Bowery. The Ghost was on the outside. The safe was a back number; to think
      of soup would have been paying it a compliment. After an hour's work with
      a can-opener, Sammy and Big Head declared themselves within ten minutes of
      the money. All that remained was to batter in the inner-lining of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Head cocked a sudden and suspicious ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sammy had just reversed the can-opener, for an attack upon that sheet-iron
      lining. He paused in mid-swing, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a pinch,&rdquo; he cried, crashing down the heavy iron tool with a
      cataract of curses. &ldquo;It's a pinch, an' th' Ghost is in on it. Agnes had
      him right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a pinch sure enough. Even as Sammy spoke, Rocheford and Wertheimer
      of the Central Office were covering them with their pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; came from Wertheimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got us bang right!&rdquo; sighed Big Head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside they found Cohen, also of the Central Office, with the ruffles on
      the Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's only a throw-off,&rdquo; sneered Sammy, pointing to the bracelets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ghost began to whine. The loose lips became looser than ever, the
      drooping lids drooped lower still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'y, Sammy,&rdquo; he remonstrated weepingly, &ldquo;youse don't t'ink I'd go an'
      give youse up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; retorted Sammy, with sullen emphasis. &ldquo;Youse'll get
      yours, Ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had the Ghost been wise he would have remained in the Tombs; it was his
      best chance. But the Ghost was-not wise. Within the week he was walking
      the streets, and trying to explain a freedom which so sharply contrasted
      with the caged condition of Big Head and Sammy Hart. Gangland turned its
      back on him; his explanations were not received. And, sluggish and thick
      as he was, Gangland made him feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was black night in University Place. The Ghost was gumshoeing his way
      towards the Bridge Saloon. A taxicab came slowly crabbing along the curb.
      It stopped; a quick figure slipped out and, muzzle on the very spot, put a
      bullet through the base of the Ghost's brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick figure leaped back into the cab. The door slammed, and the cab
      dashed off into the darkness at racing speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that splinter of time required to start the cab you might have seen&mdash;had
      you been near enough&mdash;two white small hands clutch with a kind of
      rapturous acceptance at the quick figure, as it sprang into the cab, and
      heard the eager voice of a woman saying &ldquo;Promise for promise, and word for
      word! Who wouldn't give soul and body for th' death of a snitch?&mdash;for
      a snake that will bite no more?&rdquo;

      IX.&mdash;LITTLE BOW KUM
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ince then no
      Chinaman will go into the room. I had this from Loui Fook, himself an
      eminent member of the On Leon Tong and a leading merchant of Chinatown.
      Loui Fook didn't pretend to know of his own knowledge, but spoke by
      hearsay. He said that the room was haunted. No one would live there, being
      too wise, although the owner had lowered the rent from twenty dollars a
      month to ten. Ten monthly dollars should be no inducement to live in a
      place where, at odd, not to say untoward hours, you hear sounds of
      scuffling and wing-beating, such as is made by a chicken when its head is
      chopped off. Also, little Bow Kum's blood still stains the floor in a
      broad red patch, and refuses to give way to soap and water. The wife of
      the Italian janitor&mdash;who cannot afford to be superstitious, and
      bemoans a room unrented&mdash;has scrubbed half through the boards in
      unavailing efforts to wash away the dull red splotch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detective Raphael of the Central Office heard of the ghost. He thought it
      would make for the moral uplift of Chinatown to explode so foolish a tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yong Dok begged Raphael not to visit the haunted room where the blood of
      little Bow Kum spoke in dumb, dull crimson from the floor. It would set
      the ghosts to talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come with me, and act as interpreter,&rdquo; quoth Raphael, and he threw
      Yong Dok over his heavy shoulder and began to climb the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yong Dok fainted, and lay as limp as a wet bath towel. Loui Fook said that
      Yong Dok would die if taken to the haunted room, so Raphael forbore and
      set him down. In an hour Yong Dok had measurably recovered, but Tchin Foo
      insists that he hasn't been the same man since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low Fong, Low Tching and Chu Wah, three hatchet men belonging to the Four
      Brothers, were charged with the murder. But the coroner let Chu Wah go,
      and the special sessions jury disagreed as to Low Fong and Low Tching; and
      so one way and another they were all set free.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to uncover evidence against a Chinaman. They never talk,
      and their faces are as void of expression as the wrong side of a
      tombstone. In only one way does a Chinaman betray emotion. When guilty,
      and pressed upon by danger, a pulse beats on the under side of his arm,
      just above the elbow. This is among the golden secrets known to what
      Central Office men do duty along Pell, Mott and Doyers streets, but for
      obvious reasons it cannot be used in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the white devils' law failed, the Chinese law was not so
      powerless. Because of that murder, eight Four Brothers and five On Leon
      Tongs have been shot dead. Also, slippered feet have stolen into the
      sleeping rooms of offensive ones, as they dreamed of China the Celestial
      far away beyond the sunset, and unseen bird-claw fingers have turned on
      the white devils' gas. In this way a dozen more have died. They have
      awakened in Chinatown to the merits of the white devils' gas as a method
      of assassination. It bids fair to take the place of the automatic gun,
      just as the latter shoved aside the old-time barbarous hatchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Bow Kum had reached her nineteenth year when she was killed. Her
      husband, Tchin Len, was worth $50,000. He was more than twice as old as
      little Bow Kum, and is still in Mott Street waiting for her spirit to
      return and strangle her destroyers. This will one day come to pass, and he
      is waiting for that day. Tchin Len has another wife in Canton, but he does
      not go back to her, preferring to live in Chinatown with the memory of his
      little lost Bow Kum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Bow Kum was born in the Canton district, China. Her father's name
      was Wong Hi. Her mother's name doesn't matter, because mothers do not
      amount to much in China. As she lay in her mother's lap, a chubby,
      wheat-hued baby, they named her Bow Kum, which means Sweet Flower, for
      they knew she would be very beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When little Bow Kum was five years old, Wong Hi, her father, sold her for
      $300. Wong Hi was poor, and $300 is a Canton fortune. Also, the sale had
      its moral side, since everyone knows that children are meant to be a prop
      and support to their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Bow Kum was bought and sold, as was well understood by both Wong
      Hi, the father, and the man who chinked down his hard three hundred silver
      dollars as the price, with the purpose of rearing her to a profession
      which, while not without honor among Orientals, is frowned upon by the
      white devils, and never named by them in best society. Much pains were
      bestowed upon her education; for her owner held that in the trade which at
      the age of fifteen she was to take up, she should be able to paint,
      embroider, quote Confucius, recite verses, and in all things be a mirror
      of the graces. Thus she would be more valuable, being more attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Bow Kum accepted her fate and made no protest, feeling no impulse
      so to do. She knew that she had been sold, and knew her destiny; but she
      felt no shock, was stricken by no desire to escape. What had happened and
      would happen, had been for hundreds and thousands of years the life story
      of a great feminine fraction of her people. Wherefore, the thought was at
      home in her blood; her nature bowed to and embraced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, from the white devils' view-point the fate designed for little
      Bow Kum was as the sublimation of the immoral. But you must remember that
      morality is always a question of geography and sometimes a question of
      race. Climates, temperatures, also play their part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, there is that element of support. In the tropics, where life is
      lazy, easy, and one may pick a dinner from every tree, man is polygamous.
      In the ice locked arctics, where one spears his dinner out of the cold,
      reluctant sea, and goes days and days without it, man is polyandrous, and
      one wife has many husbands. In the temperate zone, where life is neither
      soft nor hard and yet folk work to live, man is monogamous, and one wife
      to one husband is the only good form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great is latitude!
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the business of steeping the senses in drinks or drugs. That eternal
      quantity of latitude still worms its way into the equation. In the arctic
      zone they drink raw alcohol, in the north temperate whiskey, in the south
      temperate wine, while in the tropics they give up drinking and take to
      opium, hasheesh and cocaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Bow Kum watched her fifteenth year approach&mdash;that year when
      she would take up her profession&mdash;without shame, scandal or alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had you tried to show her the horrors of her situation, she wouldn't have
      understood. She was beautiful beyond beauty. This she knew very well, and
      was pleased to have her charms confessed. Her owner told her she was a
      lamp of love, and that he would not sell her under $3,000. This of itself
      was the prettiest of compliments, since he had never before asked more
      than $2,000 for a girl. Koi Ton, two years older than herself, had brought
      just $2,000; and Koi Ton was acknowledged to be a vision from heaven. And
      so when Bow Kum learned that her price was to be $3,000, a glow overspread
      her&mdash;a glow which comes to beauty when it feels itself supreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Bow Kum was four feet tall, and weighed only seventy pounds. Her
      color was the color of old ivory&mdash;that is, if you can imagine old
      ivory with the flush and blush of life. She had rose-red lips, onyx eyes,
      and hair as black as a crow's wing. One day her owner went mad with opium.
      As he sat and looked at her, and her star-like beauty grew upon him, he
      struck her down with a bamboo staff. This frightened him; for he saw that
      if he kept her he would kill her because of her loveliness. So, knowing
      himself and fearing her beauty, he sent little Bow Kum to San Francisco,
      and never laid eyes on her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having ripened into her fifteenth year, and the value of girls being up in
      San Francisco, little Bow Kum brought the price&mdash;$3,000&mdash;which
      her owner had fixed for her. She kissed the hand of Low Hee Tong, her new
      owner; and, having been adorned to the last limit of Chinese coquetry,
      went with him to a temple, dedicated to some Mongolian Venus, which he
      maintained in Ross Alley. Here little Bow Kum lived for nearly four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low Hee Tong, the Ross Alley owner of little Bow Kum, got into trouble
      with the police. Something he did or failed to do&mdash;probably the
      latter&mdash;vastly disturbed them. With that, waxing moral, they decided
      that Low Hee Tong's Temple of Venus in Ross Alley was an eyesore, and must
      be wiped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they pulled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Bow Kum&mdash;so small, so much the rose-flower which her name
      implied&mdash;aroused the concern of the judge. He gave her to a Christian
      mission, which years before had pitched its tent in Frisco's Chinatown
      with a hope of saving Mongol souls, which hope had failed. Thereafter
      little Bow Kum lived at the mission, and not in Ross Alley, and was chaste
      according to the ice-bound ideals of the white devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mission was ruled over by a middle-aged matron with a Highland name.
      This good woman was beginning to wonder what she should do with little Bow
      Kum, when that almond-eyed floweret came preferring a request. Little Bow
      Kum, while dwelling in Ross Alley, had met Tchin Len and thought him nice.
      Tchin Len owned a truck-farm near Stockton, and was rich. Would the
      Highland matron, in charge of the mission, write a letter to Tchin Len,
      near Stockton, and ask that bewitching truck-gardener to come down and see
      little Bow Kum?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; explained little Bow Kum, in her peculiar English, &ldquo;I likee
      Tchin Len to mally me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Highland matron considered. A husband in the case of little Bow Kum
      would supply a long-felt want. Also, no harm, even if no good, could flow
      from Tchin Len's visit, since she, the Highland matron, sternly purposed
      being present while Tchin Len and little Bow Kum conferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matron wrote the letter, and Tchin Len came down to San Francisco. He
      and little Bow Kum talked quietly in a language which the managing matron
      did not understand. But she knew the signs; and therefore when, at the
      close of the conversation, they explained that they had decided upon a
      wedding, she was not astonished. She gave them her blessing, about which
      they cared nothing, and they pledged each other their faith after the
      Chinese manner&mdash;which is curious, but unimportant here&mdash;about
      which they cared much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchin Len went back to his Stockton truck garden, to put his house in
      order against the wifely advent of little Bow Kum. It is not of record
      that Tchin Len said anything about his Canton wife. The chances are that
      he didn't. A Chinaman is no great hand to mention his domestic affairs to
      anybody. Moreover, a wife more or less means nothing to him. It is
      precisely the sort of thing he would forget; or, remembering, make no
      reference to, lest you vote him a bore. What looks like concealment is
      often only politeness, and goodbreeding sometimes wears the face of fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was settled that Tchin Len should marry little Bow Kum, and the latter,
      aided and abetted by the watchful mission matron, waited for the day.
      Affairs had reached this stage when the unexpected came rapping at the
      door. Low Hee Tong, who paid $3,000 for little Bow Kum and claimed to own
      her, had been keeping an eye on his delicate chattel. She might be living
      at the mission, but he no less bore her upon the sky-line of his
      calculations. Likewise he knew about the wedding making ready with Tchin
      Len. He didn't object. He simply went to Tchin Len and asked for $3,000.
      It was little enough, he said; especially when one considered that&mdash;excluding
      all others&mdash;he would convey to Tchin Len in perpetuity every right in
      and to little Bow Kum, who was so beautiful that she was hated by the
      moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchin Len said the price was low enough; that is, if Low Hee Tong
      possessed any interest in little Bow Kum to convey, which he doubted.
      Tchin Len explained that he would talk things over with the mission matron
      of the Highland name, and later let Low Hee Tong know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low Hee Tong said that this arrangement was agreeable, so long as it was
      understood that he would kill both Tchin Len and little Bow Kum in case he
      didn't get the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchin Len, after telling little Bow Kum, laid the business before the
      mission matron with the Highland name. Naturally, she was shocked. She
      said that she was amazed at the effrontery of Low Hee Tong! Under the
      white devils' law he couldn't possess and therefore couldn't pretend to
      any title in little Bow Kum. Tchin Len would be wild to pay him $3,000.
      Low Hee Tong was lucky to be alive!&mdash;only the mission matron didn't
      put it in precisely these words. If Tchin Len had $3,000 which he didn't
      need, he might better contribute it to the mission which had sheltered his
      little Bow Kum. It would be criminal to lavish it upon a yellow Pagan, who
      threatened to shed blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchin Len heard this with pigtailed phlegm and politeness, and promised to
      think about it. He said that it would give him no joy to endow Low Hee
      Tong with $3,000; he was willing that much should be understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Bow Kum was placidly present at the discussion. When it ended she
      placidly reminded Tchin Len that he knew what she knew, namely, that he in
      all probability, and she in all certainty, would be killed if Low Hee
      Tong's claim were refused. Tchin Len sighed and confessed that this was
      true. For all that, influenced by the mission matron with the Highland
      name, he was loth to give up the $3,000. Little Bow Kum bent her
      flower-like head. Tchin Len's will was her law, though as the penalty of
      such sweet submission death, bitter death, should be her portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchin Len and the mission matron held several talks; and Tchin Len and Low
      Hee Tong held several talks. But the latter did not get the $3,000. Still
      he threatened and hoped on. It was beyond his Chinese, comprehension that
      Tchin Len could be either so dishonest or so dull as not to pay him that
      money. Tchin Len was rich, and no child. Yes; he would pay. And Low Hee
      Tong, confident of his position, made ready his opium layout for a good
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mission matron and Tchin Len hit upon a plan. Tchin Len would privily
      marry little Bow Kum&mdash;that must precede all else. Upon that point of
      wedding bells, the mission matron was as moveless as Gibraltar. The knot
      tied, Tchin Len should sell out his Stockton truck-farm and move to New
      York. Then he was to send money, and the mission matron was to outfit
      little Bow Kum and ship her East. With the wretched Low Hee Tong in San
      Francisco, and Tchin Len and little Bow Kum in far New York, an
      intervening stretch of three thousand five hundred miles might be expected
      to keep the peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchin Len and little Bow Kum were married. A month later, Tchin Len left
      for New York with $50,000 under his bridal blouse. He settled down in Mott
      Street, dispatched New York exchange for $800 to the mission matron, who
      put little Bow Kum aboard the Overland Express at Oakland, together with
      three trunks and a ticket. Little Bow Kum arrived in due and proper time,
      and Tchin Len&mdash;who met her in Jersey City&mdash;after saluting her in
      the Chinese fashion, which is cold and lacks enthusiasm, bore her away to
      Seventeen Mott, where he had prepared for her a nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three septs among Chinamen. These are the On Leon Tong, the Hip
      Sing Tong and the Four Brothers. The two first are associations; the last
      is a fraternity. You can join the Hip Sing Tong or the On Leon Tong. Your
      sole chance of becoming a Four Brother lies in being born into the tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loui Fook told me these things late one night in the Port Arthur
      restaurant, where the red lamps glow and there is an all-pervading smell
      of preserved ginger, and added that the Four Brothers was very ancient.
      Its sources were lost in the dimmest vistas of Chinese antiquity, said
      Loui Fook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thousand years old?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five thousand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten thousand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From which I inferred that the Four Brothers had beheld the dawn and death
      of many centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every member of the Four Brothers is to be known by his name. When you cut
      the slippered trail of a Chinaman whose name begins with Low or Chu or
      Tching or Quong, that Chinaman is a Four Brothers. A Chinaman's first name
      is his family name. In this respect he runs counter to the habit of the
      white devils; just as he does in the matter of shirts, which the white
      devil tucks in and the Chinaman does not. Wherefore, the names of Low,
      Chu, Tching and Quong, everywhere the evidence of the Four Brothers, are
      family names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loui Fook gave me the origin of the Four Brothers&mdash;he himself is an
      On Leon Tong. Many thousands of years ago a Chinaman was travelling.
      Dusty, weary, he sat down by a well. His name was Low. Another
      travel-stained Chinaman joined him. They talked, and liked each other
      much. The second traveler's name was Chu. Then a third sat down, and the
      three talked and liked each other much. His name was Tching. Lastly, came
      a fourth Chinaman, and the weary dust lay deep upon his sandals. His name
      was Quong. He was equally talked to by the others, and by them equally
      well liked. They&mdash;the four&mdash;decided, as they parted, that
      forever and forever they and their descendants should be as brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherefore the Four Brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low Hee Tong was a member of the Four Brothers&mdash;a descendant of the
      earliest Chinaman at that well, back in the world's morning. When he found
      that Tchin Len had married little Bow Kum and stolen her away to New York,
      his opium turned bitter and he lost his peace of mind. Low Hee Tong wrote
      a Chinese letter, giving the story of his injuries, and sent it via the
      white devils' mails to Low Hee Jit, chief of the Four Brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low Hee Jit laid the case before Lee Tcin Kum, chief of the On Leon Tong.
      The wise men of the On Leon Tong appointed a hearing. Low Hee Jit came
      with the wise men of the Four Brothers to the company rooms of the On Leon
      Tong. Tchin Len and little Bow Kum were there. The question was, should
      the On Leon Tong command Tchin Len to pay Low Hee Tong $3,000&mdash;the
      price of little Bow Kum?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lee Tcin Kum and the wise men of the On Leon Tong, after long debate, said
      that Tchin Len should pay Low Hee Tong nothing. And they argued after this
      wise. The white devils' law had taken hold of little Bow Kum, and
      destroyed Low Hee Tong's title. She was no longer his property. She might
      marry whom she would, and the bridegroom owe Low Hee Tong nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was in the On Leon Tong's Company rooms in Mott Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low Hee Jit and the wise men of the Four Brothers opposed this.
      Particularly they declined the white devils' laws as of controlling pith
      and moment. Why should a Chinaman heed the white devils' laws? The white
      devils were the barbarous inferiors of the Chinese. The latter as a race
      had long ago arrived. For untold ages they had been dwelling upon the
      highest peaks of all possible human advancement. The white devils,
      centuries behind, were still blundering about among the foothills far
      below. It was an insult, between Chinaman and Chinaman, for Lee Tcin Kum
      and the wise men of the On Leon Tong to quote the white devils' laws, or
      assume to yield them respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this the council broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      War was declared by the Four Brothers against the On Leon Tong, and the
      dead-walls of Chinatown were plastered with the declaration. Since the
      white devils could not read Chinese, they knew nothing of all this. But
      the On Leon Tong knew, and the Four Brothers knew, and both sides began
      bringing in their hatchet-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a Chinaman is bent on killing, he hires an assassin. This is not
      cowardice, but convenience. The assassin never lives in the town where the
      killing is to occur. He is always imported. This is to make detection
      difficult. The Four Brothers and the On Leon Tong brought in their
      hatchet-men from Chicago, from Boston, from Pittsburg, from Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some impression of the extent of this conscription might be gathered from
      the following: When last New Year the On Leon Tong gave a public dinner at
      the Port Arthur, thirty hatchet-men were on the roof and eighty in the
      street. This was to head off any attempt the Four Brothers might make to
      blow that banquet up. I received the above from an esteemed friend of
      mine, who was a guest at the dinner, but left when told what profuse
      arrangements had been made to insure his skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchin Len and little Bow Kum kept up the fires of their love at Seventeen
      Mott. They took their daily chop suey and sharkfin, not to mention their
      bird's-nest soup, across the way at Twenty-two with their friends, Sam Lee
      and Yong Dok.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a showery, August afternoon. Tchin Len had been all day at his
      store, and little Bow Kum was sitting alone in their room. Dismal as was
      the day outside, the room showed pleasant and bright. There were
      needlework screens, hangings of brocade and silk, vases of porcelain,
      statuettes in jade. The room was rich&mdash;a scene of color and Chinese
      luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Bow Kum was the room's best ornament&mdash;with her jade bracelets,
      brocade jacket, silken trousers, golden girdle, and sandaled feet as small
      as the feet of a child of six. It would be twenty minutes before the
      Chinese dinner hour, when she was to join Tchin Len across the street, and
      she drew out pen and ink and paper that she might practice the white
      devils' way of writing; and all with the thought of some day sending a
      letter of love and gratitude to the mission matron with the Highland name.
    </p>
    <p>
      So engrossed was little Bow Kum that she observed nothing of the soft
      opening of the door, or the dark savage face which peered through. The
      murderer crept upon her as noiselessly as a shadow. There was a hawk-'like
      swoop. About the slender throat closed a grip of steel. The fingers were
      long, slim, strong. She could not cry out. The dull glimmer of a Chinese
      knife&mdash;it was later picked up in the hall, a-drip with blood&mdash;flashed
      before her frightened eyes. She made a convulsive clutch, and the blade
      was drawn horribly through her baby fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over across, not one hundred feet away, sat Tchin Len and his two friends
      in the eating room of Twenty-two. It was a special day, and they would
      have chicken and rice. This made them impatient for the advent of little
      Bow Kum. She was already ten minutes behind the hour. His friends rallied
      Tchin Len about little Bow Kum, and evolved a Chinese joke to the effect
      that he was a slave to her beauty and had made a foot-rest of his heart
      for her little feet. Twenty minutes went by, and his friends had grown too
      hungry to jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchin Len went over to Seventeen, to bring little Bow Kum. As he pushed
      open the door, he saw the little silken brocaded form, like a child
      asleep, lying on the floor. Tchin Len did not understand; he thought
      little Bow Kum was playing with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Bow Kum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lean fingers had torn the slender throat. Her baby hand was cut half
      in two, where the knife had been snatched away. The long blade had been
      driven many times through and through the little body. A final slash,
      hari-kari fashion and all across, had been the awful climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends found Tchin Len, seated on the floor, with little Bow Kum in
      his arms. Grief was neither in his eyes nor in his mouth, for his mind,
      like his heart, had been made empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchin Len waits for the vengeance of little Bow Kum to fall upon her
      murderers. Some say that Tchin Len was a fool for not paying Low Hee Tong
      the $3,000. Some call him dishonest. All agree that the cross-fire of
      killings, which has raged and still rages because of it, can do little Bow
      Kum no good.

      X.&mdash;THE COOKING OF CRAZY BUTCH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his is not so much
      to chronicle the bumping off of Crazy Butch, as to open a half-gate of
      justice in the maligned instance of the Darby Kid. There is subdued
      excitement in and about the Central Office. There is more excitement,
      crossed with a color of bitterness, in and about the Chatham Club. The
      Central Office, working out a tip, believes it has cut the trail of Harry
      the Soldier, who, with Dopey Benny, is wanted for the killing of Crazy
      Butch. The thought which so acrimoniously agitates the Chatham Club is
      &ldquo;Who rapped?&rdquo; with the finger of jealous suspicion pointing sourly at the
      Darby Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      That you be not misled in an important particular, it is well perhaps to
      explain that the Darby Kid is a girl&mdash;a radiant girl&mdash;and in her
      line as a booster, a girl of gold. She deeply loved Crazy Butch, having
      first loved Harry the Soldier. If she owned a fault, it was that in
      matters of the heart she resembled the heroine of the flat boatman's
      muse.=
    </p>
    <p>
      ```There was a womern in our town
    </p>
    <p>
      ````In our town did dwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      ```She loved her husband dear-i-lee
    </p>
    <p>
      ````An' another man twict as well.=
    </p>
    <p>
      But that is not saying she would act as stool-pigeon. To charge that the
      Darby Kid turned copper, and wised up the Central Office dicks concerning
      the whereabouts of Harry the Soldier, is a serious thing. The imputation
      is a grave one. Even the meanest ought not to be disgraced as a snitch in
      the eyes of all Gangland, lightly and upon insufficient evidence. There
      were others besides the Darby Kid who knew how to locate Harry the
      Soldier. Might not one of these have given a right steer to the bulls? Not
      that the Darby Kid can be pictured as altogether blameless. She
      indubitably did a foolish thing. Having received that letter, she should
      never have talked about it. Such communications cannot be kept too secret.
      Some wretched talebearer must have been lounging about the Chatham Club.
      Why not? The Chatham Club can no more guarantee the character of its
      patrons than can the Waldorf-Astoria.

    <p>
      The evening was a recent one. It was also dull. There wasn't an overflow
      of customers, hardly enough in waiting on them, to take the stiffness out
      of Nigger Mike's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nine of the clock, and those two inseparables, the Irish Wop and
      old Jimmy, sat in their usual chairs. The Wop spoke complainingly of the
      poolroom trade, which was even duller than trade at the Chatham Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at wit' killin' New York racin',&rdquo; said the Wop dismally, &ldquo;an' w'at wit'
      raidin' a guy's joint every toime some av them pa-a-pers makes a crack,
      it's got th' poolrooms on th' bum. For meself I'm thinkin' av closin'.
      Every day I'm open puts me fifty dollars on th' nut. An' Jimmy, I've about

    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebby you're in wrong with th' organization.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tammany? Th' more you shtand in wit' Tammany, th' ha-a-arder you get
      slugged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Jimmy signalled to Nigger Mike for beer. &ldquo;Over to th' Little Hungary
      last night,&rdquo; remarked old Jimmy casually, &ldquo;them swell politicians has a
      dinner. I was there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last came off a little proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; said the Wop with a deprecatory shrug, &ldquo;that Cha-a-arley
      Murphy was there, too, an' that Se-r-rgeant Cram had to go along to heel
      an' handle him. I can remimber whin chuck steak an' garlic is about
      Cha-a-arley's speed. Now, whin he's bushtin' 'em open as Chief av Tammany
      Hall, it's an indless chain av champagne an' tur'pin an' canvashback, with
      patty-de-foy-grass as a chaser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Jimmy shook a severe yet lofty head. &ldquo;If some guy tells you, Wop, that
      Charley needs anybody in his corner at a dinner that guy's stringin' you.
      Charley can see his way through from napkins to toothpicks, as well as old
      Chauncey Depew. There's a lot of duffers goin' 'round knockin' Charlie.
      They're sore just because he's gettin' along, see? They'll tell you how if
      you butt him up ag'inst a dinner table, he'll about give you an imitation
      of a blind dog in a meat-shop&mdash;how he'll try to eat peas with a knife
      an' let 'em roll down his sleeve an' all that. So far as them hoboes
      knockin' Charley goes, it's to his credit. You don't want to forget, Wop,
      they never knock a dead one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In th' ould gas house days,&rdquo; enquired the Wop, &ldquo;wasn't Cha-a-arley a
      conducthor on wan av th' crosstown ca-a-ars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was! an' a good one too. That's where he got his start. He quit 'em
      when they introduced bell punches; an' I don't blame him! Them big
      companies is all alike. Which of 'em'll stand for it to give a workin' man
      a chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did thim la-a-ads lasht night make spaches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speeches? Nothin' but Trusts is to be th' issue this next pres'dential
      campaign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now about thim trushts? I've been wantin' to ashk yez th' long time. I've
      been hearin' av trushts for tin years, an' Mary save me! if I'd know wan
      if it was to come an' live next dure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Wop,&rdquo; returned old Jimmy engigmatically, &ldquo;a trust is anything you
      don't like&mdash;only so it's a corp'ration. So long as it stands in with
      you an' you like it, it's all right, see? But once it takes to handin' you
      th' lemon, it's a trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speakin' av th' pris'dency, it looks loike this fat felly Taft's out to
      get it in th' neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surest ever! Th' trusts is sore on him; an' th' people is sore on him.
      He's a frost at both ends of th' alley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at crabbed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too small in th' hat-band, too big in th' belt. Them republicans better
      chuck Taft in th' discard an' take up Teddy. There's a live one! There's
      th' sturdy plow-boy of politics who'd land 'em winner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Nailer came strolling in and pulled up a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roosevelt, Jimmy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;couldn't make th' run. Don't he start th'
      argument himself, th' time he's elected, sayin' it's his second term an'
      he'll never go out for th' White House goods again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shure he did,&rdquo; coincided the Wop. &ldquo;An' r-r-right there he give himsilf
      th' gate. You're right, Nailer; he's barred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teddy oughtn't to have got off that bluff about not runnin' ag'in,&rdquo;
       observed old Jimmy thoughtfully. &ldquo;He sees it himself now. Th' next day
      after he makes his crack, a friend of mine, who's down to th' White House,
      asks him about it; is it for the bleachers,' says my friend, 'or does it
      go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, it goes!' says Teddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Then,' says my friend, 'you'll pardon me, but I don't think it was up to
      you to say it. It may wind up by puttin' everybody an' everything in
      Dutch. No sport can know what he'll want to do, or what he ought to do,
      four years ahead. Bein' pres'dent now, with four years to draw to, you can
      no more tell whether or no you'll want to repeat than you can tell what
      you'll want for dinner while you're eatin' lunch. Once I knew a guy who's
      always ready to swear off whiskey, when he's half full. Used to chase
      round to th' priest, on his own hunch; to sign th' pledge, every time he
      gets a bun. Bein' soaked, he feels like he'll never want another drink.
      After he'd gone without whiskey a couple of days, however, he'd wake up to
      it that he's been too bigoted. He'd feel that he's taken too narrow a view
      of th' liquor question, an' commence to see things in their true colors.'
      That's what my friend told him. And now that Teddy's show-in' signs, I've
      wondered whether he recalls them warnin' words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at'll th' demmycrats do?&rdquo; asked the Nailer. &ldquo;Run Willyum Jennin's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will,&rdquo; retorted the Wop scornfully, &ldquo;if they want to get th' hoot.
      Three toimes has this guy Bryan run&mdash;an' always f'r th' end book.
      D'yez moind, Jimmy, how afther th' Denver Convention lie cha-a-ases down
      to th' depot to shake ha-a-ands wit' Cha-a-arley Murphy? There's no class
      to that! Would Washin'ton have done it?&mdash;Would Jefferson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was he hoited be shakin' hands wit' Murphy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Nailer's tones were almost defiant. He had been brought up with a
      profound impression of the grandeur of Tammany Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was he hur-r-rted? D'yez call it th' cun-nin' play f'r him to be at
      th' depot, hand stretched out, an' yellin' 'Mitt me, Cha-a-arley, mitt
      me?' Man aloive, d'yez think th' country wants that koind av a ska-a-ate
      in th' White House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The acrid emphasis of the Wop was so overwhelming that it swept the Nailer
      off his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wop resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wan thing, that depot racket wasn't th' way to carry New York. Th' way to
      bring home th' darby in th' Empire Shtate is to go to th' flure wit'
      Tammany at th' ringin' av th' gong. How was it Cleveland used to win? Was
      it be makin' a pet av Croker, or sendin' th' organization flowers? An' yez
      don't have to be told what happened to Cleveland. An' Tammany, moind yez,
      tryin' to thump his proshpecks on th' nut ivery fut av th' way! If Willyum
      Jinnin's had been th' wise fowl, he'd have took his hunch fr'm th' career
      av Cleveland, an' rough-housed Tammany whiniver an' wheriver found. If
      he'd only knocked Tammany long enough an' ha-a-ard enough, he'd have had
      an anchor-nurse on th' result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sounds like treason, Wop,&rdquo; said old Jimmy in tones of mock reproach.
      &ldquo;Croker was boss in th' Cleveland days. You'll hardly say that Charlie
      ain't a better chief than Croker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy, there's as much difference bechune ould man Croker an' Cha-a-arley
      Murphy as bechune a buffalo bull an' a billy-goat. To make Murphy chief
      was loike settin' a boy to carryin' hod. While yez couldn't say f'r shure
      whether he'd fall fr'm th' laddher or simply sit down wit' th' hod, it's a
      cinch he'd niver get th' bricks to th' scaffold. Murphy's too busy
      countin' th' buttons on his Prince Albert, an' balancin' th' gold
      eye-glasshes on th' ridge av his nose, to lave him anny toime f'r
      vict'ry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While youse guys,&rdquo; observed the Nailer, with a great air of knowing
      something, &ldquo;is indulgin' in your spiels about Murphy, don't it ever strike
      youse that he's out to make Gaynor pres'dent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gaynor?&rdquo; repeated old Jimmy, in high offence. &ldquo;Do you think Charlie's
      balmy? If it ever gets so that folks of th' Gaynor size is looked on as
      big enough for th' presidency, I for one shall retire to th' booby house
      an' devote th' remainder of an ill-spent life to cuttin' paper dolls. An'
      yet, Nailer, I oughtn't to wonder at youse either for namin' him. There's
      a Demmycrat Club mutt speaks to me about that very thing at th' Little
      Hungary dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Gaynor is a college graduate,' says the Demmycrat Clubber. 'Is he?' says
      I. 'Well then he ought to chase around to that college an' make 'em give
      him back his money. They swindled him.' 'Look at th' friends he has!' says
      th' Clubber. 'I've been admirin' 'em,' I says. 'What with one thing an'
      another, them he's appointed to office has stole everything but th' back
      fence.' 'But didn't Croker, in his time, hook him up with Tammany Hall?'
      says th' Clubber; 'that ought to show you!' 'Croker did,' says I; 'it's an
      old Croker trick. Croker was forever get-tin' th' Gaynors an' th'
      Shepherds an' th' Astor-Chanlers an' th' Cord Meyers an' all them
      high-fly-in' guys into Tammany. He does it for th' same reason they puts a
      geranium in a tenement house window.' 'An' w'at may that be?' asks the
      Clubber. 'Th' geranium's intended,' says I, 'to engage th' eye of th'
      Health Inspector, an' distract his attention from th' drain.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Darby Kid, a bright dancing light in her eyes and all a-flutter,
      rushed in. The Nailer crossed over to a table at which sat Mollie Squint.
      The Darby Kid joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at do youse think?&rdquo; cried the Darby Kid. &ldquo;I'm comin' out of me flat
      when th' postman slips me a letter from Harry th' Soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Mollie Squint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's th' funny part. He's in th' Eyetalian Army, an' headed for Africa.
      That's a fine layout, I don't think! An' he says I'm th' only goil he ever
      loves, an' asts me to join him! Ain't he got his nerve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'y? You ain't mad because he croaks Butch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But me for Africa!&mdash;the ideer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Dopey Benny?&rdquo; said the Nailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry says Benny got four spaces in Canada. It's a bank trick&mdash;tryin'
      to blow a box in Montreal or somethin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you won't join Harry?&rdquo; remarked Mollie Squint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Africa? When I do, I'll toin mission worker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day the Central Office knew all that the Darby Kid knew as to
      Harry the Soldier. But why say it was she who squealed? The Nailer and
      Mollie Squint were quite as well informed as herself, having read Harry's
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin at the foundation and go to the eaves&mdash;which is the only
      right way to build either a house or a story. Crazy Butch had reached his
      twenty-eighth year, when he died and was laid to rest in accordance with
      the ceremonial of his ancient church. He was a child of the East Side, and
      his vices out-topped his virtues upon a principle of sixteen to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parents of Butch may be curtly dismissed as unimportant. They gave him
      neither care nor guidance, but left him to grow up, a moral straggler, in
      what tangled fashion he would. Never once did they show him the moral way
      in which he should go. Not that Butch would have taken it if they had.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Butch, as to Gangland in general, morality was as so much lost motion.
      And, just as time-is money among honest folk, so was motion money with
      Butch and his predatory kind. Old Jimmy correctly laid down the Gangland
      position, which was Butch's position. Said old Jimmy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morality is all to the excellent for geeks with dough to burn an' time to
      throw away. It's right into the mitts of W'ite Chokers, who gets paid for
      bein' good an' hire out to be virchuous for so much a year. But of what
      use is morality to a guy along the Bowery? You could take a cartload of it
      to Simpson's, an' you couldn't get a dollar on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not much was known of the childhood of Butch, albeit his vacuous lack of
      book knowledge assisted the theory that little or less of it had been
      passed in school. Nor was that childhood a lengthy one, for fame began
      early to collect upon Butch's scheming brow. He was about the green and
      unripe age of thirteen when he went abroad into the highways and byways of
      the upper city and stole a dog of the breed termed setter. This animal he
      named Rabbi, and trained as a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rabbi, for many months, was Butch's meal ticket. The method of their
      thievish procedure was simple but effective. Butch&mdash;Rabbi alertly at
      his godless heels&mdash;would stroll about the streets looking for prey.
      When some woman drifted by, equipped of a handbag of promise, Butch
      pointed out the same to the rascal notice of Rabbi. After which the
      discreet Butch withdrew, the rest of it&mdash;as he said&mdash;being up to
      Rabbi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rabbi followed the woman, his abandoned eye on the hand-bag. Watching his
      chance, Rabbi rushed the woman and dexterously whisked the handbag from
      out her horrified fingers. Before the woman realized her loss, Rabbi had
      raced around a nearest corner and was lost to all pursuit. Fifteen minutes
      later he would find Butch at Willett and Stanton Streets, and turn over
      the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rabbi hated a policeman like a Christian. The sight of one would send him
      into growling, snarling, hiding. None the less, like all great characters,
      Rabbi became known; and, in the end, through some fraud which was
      addressed to his softer side and wherein a canine Delilah performed, he
      Avas betrayed into the clutches of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mischance marked the close, as a hanger-snatcher, of the invaluable
      Rabbi's career. Not that the plain-clothes people who caught him affixed a
      period to his doggish days. Even a plains-clothes man isn't entirely hard.
      Rabbi's captors merely found him a home in the Catskills, where he spent
      his days in honor and his nights in sucking unsuspected eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rabbi was retired to private life, Butch, in his bread-hunting,
      resolved to seek new paths. Among the cruder crimes is house-breaking and
      to it the amateur law-breaker most naturally turns. Butch became a
      house-worker with special reference to flats.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning, Butch worked in the day time, or as they say in
      Gangland, &ldquo;went out on <i>skush.</i>&rdquo; Hating the sun, however, as all true
      criminals, must, he shifted to night jobs, and took his dingy place in the
      ranks of viciousness as a <i>schlamwerker</i>. As such he turned off
      houses, flats and stores, taking what Fate sent him. Occasionally he
      varied the dull monotony of simple burglary by truck-hopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man cannot live by burglary alone, and Butch was not without his
      gregarious side. Seeking comradeship, he united himself with the Eastman
      gang. As a gangster he soon distinguished himself. He fought like a
      berserk; and it was a sort of war-frenzy, which overtook him in battle,
      that gave him his honorable prefix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monk Eastman thought well of Butch. Not even Ike the Blood stood nearer
      than did Butch to the heart of that grim gang captain. Eastman's weakness
      was pigeons. When he himself went finally to Sing Sing, he asked the court
      to permit him another week in the Tombs, so that he might find a father
      for his five hundred feathered pets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days when Butch came to strengthen as well as ornament his forces,
      Eastman kept a bird store in Broome Street, under the New Irving Hall.
      Eastman also rented bicycles. Those who thirsted to stand well with him
      were sedulous to ride a wheel. They rented these uneasy engines of
      Eastman, with the view of drawing to themselves that leader's favor.
      Butch, himself, was early astride a bicycle. One time and another he paid
      into Eastman's hands the proceeds of many a <i>shush</i> or <i>schlam</i>
      job; and all for the calf-developing privilege of pedalling about the
      streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Butch conceived an idea which peculiarly endeared him to Eastman. In
      Forsyth Street was a hall, and Butch&mdash;renting the same&mdash;organized
      an association which, in honorable advertisement of his chief's trade of
      pigeons and bicycles, he called the Squab-Wheelmen. Eastman himself stood
      godfather to this club, and at what times he reposed himself from his bike
      and pigeon labors, played pool in its rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      There occurred that which might have shaken one less firmly established
      than Butch. As it was, it but solidified him and did him good. The world
      will remember the great gang battle, fought at Worth and Center Streets,
      between the Eastmans and the Five Points. The merry-making was put an end
      to by those spoil sports, the police, who, as much without noble
      sympathies as chivalric instincts, drove the contending warriors from the
      field at the point of their night sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brief as was the fray, numerous were the brave deeds done. On one side or
      the other, the Dropper, the Nailer, Big Abrams, Ike the Blood, Slimmy,
      Johnny Rice, Jackeen Dalton, Biff Ellison and the Grabber distinguished
      themselves. As for Butch, he was deep within the warlike thick of things,
      and no one than he came more to the popular front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sequential to that jousting, a thought came to Butch. The Squab-Wheelmen
      were in nightly expectation of an attack from the Five Pointers. By way of
      testing their valor, and settle definitely, in event of trouble, who would
      stick and who would duck, Butch one midnight, came rushing up the
      stairway, which led to the club rooms, blazing with two pistols at once.
      Butch had prevailed upon five or six others, of humor as jocose as his
      own, to assist, and the explosive racket the party made in the narrow
      stairway was all that heart could have wished. It was comparable only to a
      Mott Street Chinese New Year's, as celebrated in front of the Port Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were sixty members in the rooms of the Squab-Wheelmen when Butch led
      up his feigned attack, and it is discouraging to relate that most if not
      all of them fled. Little Kishky, sitting in a window, was so overcome that
      he fell out backwards, and broke his neck. Some of those who fled, by way
      of covering their confusion, were inclined to make a deal of the death of
      Little Kishky and would have had it set to the discredit of Butch.
      Gangland opinion, however, was against them. If Little Kishky hadn't been
      a quitter, he would never have fallen out. Butch was not only exonerated
      but applauded. He had devised&mdash;so declared Gangland&mdash;an ideal
      method of separating the sheep who would fly from the goats who would stay
      and stand fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, there was the laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gangland was quick to see the humorous side; and since humanity is prone
      to decide as it laughs, Gangland overwhelmingly declared in favor of
      Butch.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about this time that Butch found himself in a jam. His <i>schlam</i>
      work had never been first class. It was the want of finish to it which
      earned him the name of Butch. The second night after his stampede of the
      Squab-Wheelmen, his clumsiness in a Brooklyn flat woke up a woman, who
      woke up the neighborhood. Whereupon, the neighborhood rushed in and sat
      upon the body of Butch, until the police came to claim him. Subsequently,
      a Kings County judge saw his way clear to send Butch up the river for four
      weary years. And did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Butch was older and soberer when he returned. Also, his world had changed.
      Eastman had been put away, and Ritchie Fitzpatrick ruled in his place.
      Butch cultivated discretion, where before he had been hot and headlong,
      and no longer sought that gang prominence which was formerly as the breath
      to his nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that Butch altogether turned his back upon his old-time associates.
      The local Froissarts tell how he, himself, captained a score or so of
      choice spirits among the Eastmans, against the Humpty Jackson gang, beat
      them, took them prisoners and plundered them. This brilliant action
      occurred in that Fourteenth Street graveyard which was the common hang-out
      of the Humpty Jacksons. Also, Humpty Jackson commanded his partisans in
      person, and was captured and frisked with the rest. Butch gained much
      glory and some money; for the Jacksons&mdash;however it happened&mdash;chanced
      to be flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Butch, returning from Sing-Sing exile, did not return to his <i>schlam</i>
      work. That trip up-the-river had shaken him. He became a Fagin, and taught
      boys of tender years to do his stealing for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Butch's mob of kids counted as many as twenty, all trained in
      pocket-picking to a feather-edge. As aiding their childish efforts, it was
      Butch's habit to mount a bicycle, and proceed slowly down the street, his
      fleet of kids going well abreast of him on the walks. Acting the part of
      some half-taught amateur of the wheel, Butch would bump into a man or a
      woman, preferably a woman. There would be cries and a scuffle. The woman
      would scold, Butch would expound and explain. Meanwhile the wren-head
      public packed itself ten deep about the center of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Butch's young adherents pushed their shrewd way in.
      Little hands went flying, to reap a very harvest of pokes. Butch began
      building up a bank account.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an excuse for living, and to keep his mob together, Butch opened a pool
      parlor. This temple of enjoyment was in a basement in Willett Street near
      Stanton. The tariff was two-and-a-half cents a cue, and what Charley
      Bateses and Artful Dodgers worked for Butch were wont to refresh
      themselves at the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Butch made money with both hands. He took his share as a Fagin. Then, what
      fragmentary remnants of their stealings he allowed his young followers,
      was faithfully blown in by them across his pool tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagination rules the world. Butch, having imagination, extended himself.
      Already a Fagin, Butch became a <i>posser</i> and bought stolen goods for
      himself. Often, too, he acted as a <i>melina</i> and bought for others.
      Thus Butch had three strings to his business bow. He was getting rich and
      at the same time keeping out of the fingers of the bulls. This caused him
      to be much looked up to and envied, throughout the length and breadth of
      Gangland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Butch was thus prosperous and prospering when it occurred to him to fall
      in love. Harry the Soldier was the Mark Antony of the Five Points, his
      Cleopatra the Darby Kid. There existed divers reasons for adoring the
      Darby Kid. There was her lustrous eyes, her coral mouth, her rounded
      cheek, her full figure, her gifts as a shop lifter. As a graceful crown to
      these attractions, the Darby Kid could pick a pocket with the best wire
      that ever touched a leather. In no wise had she been named the Darby Kid
      for nothing. Not even Mollie Squint was her superior at getting the bundle
      of a boob. They said, and with truth, that those soft, deep, lustrous eyes
      could look a sucker over, while yet that unconscious sucker was ten feet
      away, and locate the keck wherein he carried his roll. Is it astonishing
      then that the heart of Butch went down on its willing knees to the Darby
      Kid?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another matter:&mdash;Wasn't the Darby Kid the chosen one of Harry the
      Soldier? Was not Harry a Five Pointer? Had not Butch, elbow to elbow, with
      his great chief, Eastman, fought the Five Pointers in the battle at Worth
      and Center? It was a triumph, indeed, to win the heart of the Darby Kid.
      It was twice a triumph to steal that heart away from Harry the Soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Darby Kid crossed over from Harry the Soldier to Butch, and brought
      her love along. Thereafter her smiles were for Butch, her caresses for
      Butch, her touches for Butch. Harry the Soldier was left desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry the Soldier was a gon of merit and deserved eminence. That he had
      been an inmate not only of the House of Refuge but the Elmira Reformatory,
      should show you that he was a past-master at his art. His steady partner
      was Dopey Benny. With one to relieve the other in the exacting duties of
      stinger, and a couple of good stalls to put up an effective back, trust
      them, at fair or circus or theatre break, to make leathers, props and
      thimbles fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Gangland decision that for Butch to win the Darby Kid away from
      Harry the Soldier, even as Paris aforetime took the lovely Helen from her
      Menelaus, touched not alone the honor of Harry but the honor of the Five
      Points. Harry must revenge himself. Still more must he revenge the Five
      Points. It had become a case of Butch's life or his. On no milder terms
      could Harry sustain himself in Gangland first circles. His name else would
      be despised anywhere and everywhere that the fair and the brave were wont
      to come together and unbuckle socially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Butch, tall and broad and strong, smooth of face, arched of nose, was a
      born hawk of battle. Harry the Soldier, dark, short, of no muscular power,
      was not the physical equal of Butch. Butch looked forward with confidence
      to the upcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' yet, Butch,&rdquo; sweetly warned the Darby Kid, her arms about his neck,
      &ldquo;you mustn't go to sleep at the switch. Harry'll nail you if youse do.
      It'll be a gun-fight, an' he's a dream wit' a gatt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about that gatt thing! Do youse think, dearie, I'd let that
      Guinea cop a sneak on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a cool evening in September. A dozen of Butch's young gons were
      knocking the balls about his pool tables. Butch himself was behind the
      bar. Outside in Willett Street a whistle sounded. Butch picked up a pistol
      off the drip-board, just in time to peg a shot at Harry the Soldier as
      that ill-used lover came through the front door. Dopey Benny, Jonathan to
      the other's David, was with Harry. Neither tried to shoot. Through a hail
      of lead from Butch's pistol, the two ran out the back door. No one killed;
      no one wounded. Butch had been shooting too high, as the bullet-raked
      ceiling made plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Butch explained his wretched gun play by saying that he was afraid of
      pinking some valued one among his boy scouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it's just as well. Them wops 'll never come back.
      Now when they see I'm organized they'll stay away. There ain't no sand in
      them Sicilians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Butch was wrong. Harry, with Dopey Benny, was back the next night. This
      time there was no whistle. Harry had sent forward a force of skirmishers
      to do up those sentinels, with whom Butch had picketed Willett' Street.
      Butch's earliest intimation that there was something doing came when a
      bullet from the gun of Harry broke his back. Dopey Benny stood off the
      public, while Harry put three more bullets into Butch. The final three
      were superfluous, however, as was shown at the inquest next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Darby Kid was abroad upon her professional duties as a gon-moll, when
      Harry hived Butch. Her absence was regretted by her former lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, as he and Dopey Benny fled down Stanton Street, &ldquo;I'd
      like to have made the play a double header, and downed the Kid along wit'
      Butch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not so written, however. Double headers, whatever the field of
      human effort, are the exception and not the rule of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was whispered that Harry the Soldier and Dopey Benny remained three
      days in the Pell Street room of Big Mike Abrams before their get-away.
      They might have been at the bottom of the lower bay, for all the Central
      Office knew. Butch was buried, and the Darby Kid wept over his grave.
      After which she cheered up, and came back smiling. There is no good in
      grief. Besides, it's egotistical, and trenches upon conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Central Office declares that, equipped of the right papers, it will
      bring Harry the Soldier back from Africa. Also, it will go after Dopey
      Benny in Kanuckland, when his time is out. The chair&mdash;says the
      Central Office&mdash;shall yet have both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jimmy doesn't think there's a chance, while the jaundiced Wop openly
      scoffs. Neither believes in the police. Meanwhile dark suspicions hover
      cloudily over the Darby Kid. Did she rap? She says not, and offers to pawn
      her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; asks the Darby Kid. &ldquo;Of course I'd sooner it was Butch
      copped Harry. But it went the other way; an' why should I holler? Would
      beefin' bring Butch back?&rdquo;

      XI.&mdash;BIG MIKE ABRAMS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his was after
      Nigger Mike had gone into exile in cold and sorrowful Toronto, and while
      Tony Kelly did the moist honors at Number Twelve Pell. Nigger Mike, you
      will remember, hurried to his ruin on the combined currents of enthusiasm
      and many drinks, had registered a score or two of times; for he meditated
      casting full fifty votes at the coming election, in his own proper person,
      and said so to his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mike registered those numerous times, the snap-shot hirelings of
      certain annoying reformers were busy popping him with their cameras. His
      friends informed him of this, and counselled going slow. But Mike was
      beyond counsel, and knew little or less of cameras&mdash;never having had
      his picture taken save officially, and by the rules of Bertillon. In the
      face of those who would have saved him, he continued to stagger in and out
      upon that multifarious registration, inviting destruction. The purists
      took the pictures to the District Attorney, their hirelings told their
      tales, and Mike perforce went into that sad Toronto exile. He is back now,
      however, safe, sober, clothed and in his right mind; but that is another
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had been a sweltering July day for all of Chinatown. Now that
      night had come, the narrowness of Pell and Doyers and Mott Streets was
      choked with Chinamen, sitting along the curb, lolling in doorways, or
      slowly drifting up and down, making the most of the cool of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over across from Number Twelve a sudden row broke out. There were
      smashings and crashings, loopholed, as it were, with shrill Mongolian
      shrieks. The guests about Tony's tables glanced up with dull,
      half-interested eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Big Mike Abrams tearin' th' packin' out of th' laundry across th'
      street,&rdquo; said Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony was at the front door when the war broke forth, and had come aft to
      explain. Otherwise those about his tables might have gone personally
      forth, seeking a solution of those yellings and smashings and crashings
      for themselves, and the flow of profitable beer been thereby interrupted.
      At Tony's explanation his guests sat back in their chairs, and ordered
      further beer. Which shows that Tony had a knowledge of his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About them socialists,&rdquo; resumed Sop Henry, taking up the talk where it
      had broken off; &ldquo;Big Tom Foley tells me that they're gettin' something
      fierce. They cast more'n thirty thousand votes last Fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; broke in the Nailer, &ldquo;I can't understand about a socialist. He must
      be on the level at that; for one evenin', when they're holdin' a meetin'
      in the Bowery, a fleet of gons goes through a dozen of 'em, an', exceptin'
      for one who's an editor, and has pulled off a touch somewheres, there
      ain't street car fare in all their kecks. That shows there's nothin' in it
      for 'em. Th' editor has four bones on him&mdash;hardly enough for a round
      of drinks an' beef stews. Th' mob blows it in at Flynn's joint, down be
      th' corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm like you, Nailer,&rdquo; agreed Sop Henry. &ldquo;Them socialists have certainly
      got me goin'. I can't get onto their coives at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lishten, then.&rdquo; This came from the Irish Wop, who was nothing if not
      political. &ldquo;Lishten to me. Yez can go to shleep on it, I know all about a
      socialist. There's ould Casey's son, Barney&mdash;ould Casey that med a
      killin' in ashphalt. Well, since his pah-pah got rich, young Casey's a
      socialist. On'y his name ain't Barney now, it's Berna-a-ard. There's
      slathers av thim sons av rich min turnin' socialists. They ain't strong
      enough to git a fall out av either av th' big pa-a-arties, so they rush
      off to th' socialists, where be payin' fer th' shpot light, they're
      allowed to break into th' picture. That's th' way wit' young Barney, ould
      Ashphalt Casey's son. Wan evenin' he dr-r-ives up to Lyon's wit' his
      pah-pah's broom, two bob-tailed horses that spint most av their time on
      their hind legs, an' th' Casey coat av arms on the broom dure, th' same
      bein' a shtick av dynamite rampant, wit' two shovels reversed on a field
      av p'tatoes. 'How ar-r-re ye?' he says. 'I want yez to jump in an' come
      wit' me to th' Crystal Palace. It's a socialist meet-in',' he says. 'Oh,
      it is?' says I; 'an' phwat's a socialist? Is it a game or a musical
      inshtrumint?' Wit' that he goes into p'ticulars. 'Well,' thinks I,
      'there's th' ride, annyhow; an' I ain't had a carriage ride since
      Eat-'em-up-Jack packed in&mdash;saints rest him! So I goes out to th'
      broom; an' bechune th' restlessness av thim bob-tailed horses an' me not
      seein' a carriage fer so long, I nearly br-r-roke me two legs gettin' in.
      However, I wint. An' I sat on th' stage; an' I lishtened to th'
      wind-jammin'; an' not to go no further, a socialist is simply an anarchist
      who don't believe in bombs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There arose laughter and loud congratulatory sounds about the door. Next,
      broadly smiling, utterly complacent, Big Mike Abrams walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did youse lobsters hear me handin' it to th' monkeys?&rdquo; he asked, and his
      manner was the manner of him who doubts not the endorsement of men. &ldquo;That
      chink, Low Foo, snakes two of me shirts. I sends him five, an' he on'y
      sends back three. So I caves in his block wit' a flatiron. You ought to
      pipe his joint! I leaves it lookin' like a poolroom that won't prodooce,
      after the wardman gets through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' Low Foo?&rdquo; queried Tony, who had shirts of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a couple of monks carries him to his bunk out back. It'll take
      somethin' more'n a shell of hop to chase away his troubles!&rdquo; Mike
      refreshed himself with a glass of beer, which he called suds. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he
      continued with much fervor, &ldquo;I wisht I could get a job punchin' monks at a
      dollar a monk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mike Abrams, <i>alias</i> Big Mike, was a pillar of Chinatown, and added
      distinctly to the life of that quarter. He was nearly six feet tall, with
      shoulders as square as the foretopsail yard of a brig. His nervous arms
      were long and slingy, his bony hands the size of hams. Neither the Dropper
      nor yet Big Myerson could swap blows with him, and his hug&mdash;if it
      came to rough-and-tumble&mdash;was comparable only to the hug of Mersher
      the Strong Arm, who had out-hugged a bear for the drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he lived, Little Maxie greatly appreciated Big Mike. Little Maxie is
      dead now. He ranked in the eyes of Mulberry Street as the best tool that
      ever nailed a leather. To be allowed to join out with his mob was
      conclusive of one's cleverness as a gon. For Maxie would have no bunglers,
      no learners about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, yet, as he himself said, Big Mike's value
    </p>
    <p>
      Jay not in any deftness of fingers, but in his stout, unflinching heart,
      and a knock-down strength of fist like unto the blow of a maul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a stall he's worse'n a dead one,&rdquo; Maxie had said. &ldquo;No one ever put up
      a worse back. But let a sucker raise a roar, or some galoot of a country
      sheriff start something&mdash;that's where Mike comes on. You know last
      summer, when I'm followin' Ringling's show? Stagger, Beansey an' Mike's
      wit' me as bunchers. Over at Patterson we had a rumble. I got a rube's
      ticker, a red one. He made me; an' wit' that youse could hear th' yell he
      lets out of him in Newark. A dozen of them special bulls which Ringling
      has on his staff makes a grab at us. Youse should have lamped Mike! Th'
      way he laid out them circus dicks was like a tune of music. It's done in a
      flash, an' every last guy of us makes his get-away. Hock your socks, it's
      Mike for me every time! I'd sooner he filled in wit' a mob of mine than
      th' best dip that ever pinched a poke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Mike had been a fixed star in the Gangland firmament for years. He
      knew he could slug, he knew he could stay; and he made the most of these
      virtues. When not working with Little Maxie, he took short trips into the
      country with an occasional select band of yeggs, out to crack a P. O. or a
      jug. At such times, Mike was the out-side man&mdash;ever a post of
      responsibility. The out-side man watches while the others blow the box. In
      case things take to looking queer or leary, he is to pass the whistle of
      warning to his pals. Should an officer show unexpectedly up, he must stand
      him off at the muzzle of his gatt, and if crowded, shoot and shoot to
      kill. He is to stand fast by his partners, busy with wedges, fuse and soup
      inside, and under no circumstances to desert them. Mike was that one of
      ten thousand, who had the nerve and could be relied upon to do and be
      these several iron things. Wherefore, he lived not without honor in the
      land, and never was there a fleet of yeggs or a mob of gons, but received
      him into its midst with joy and open hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike made a deal of money. Not that it stuck to hum; for he was born with
      his hands open and spent it as fast as he made it. Also, he drank deeply
      and freely, and moreover hit the pipe. Nor could he, in the latter
      particular, be called a pleasure smoker nor a Saturday nighter. Mike had
      the habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time Mike ran an opium den at Coney Island, and again on the second
      floor of Number Twelve Pell. But the police&mdash;who had no sure way of
      gauging the profits of opium&mdash;demanded so much for the privilege that
      Mike was forced to close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them bulls wanted all I made an' more,&rdquo; complained Mike, recounting his
      wrongs to Beansey. &ldquo;I had a 50-pipe joint that time in Pell, an' from the
      size of the rake-off the captain's wardman asks, you'd have thought that
      every pipe's a roulette-wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't you do nothin' wit' 'em?&rdquo; asked Bean-sey, sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a t'ing. I shows 'em that number-one hop is $87.50 a can, an'
      yen-chee or seconds not less'n $32. Nothin' doin'! It's either come across
      wit' five hundred bones th' foist of every month, or quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mike sighed over his fair prospects, blighted by the ignorant avarice of
      the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at was youse chargin' a smoke?&rdquo; inquired Beansey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two bits a shell. Of course, that's for yen-chee. I couldn't give 'em
      number-one for two bits. After all, w'at I cares most for is me cats&mdash;two
      long-haired Persians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cats?&rdquo; repeated Beansey, suspiciously. &ldquo;W'at be youse handin' me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beansey by the way, knew nothing of opium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at am I handin' youse?&rdquo; said Mike. &ldquo;I'm handin' you th' goods. Cats get
      th' habit same as people. My cats would plant be some party who's cookin'
      a pill, an' sniff th' hop an' get as happy as anybody. Take 'em off the
      pipe, an' it's th' same as if they're Christians. Dogs, too. Let 'em once
      get th' habit, an' then take 'em away from a pipe joint, an' they has
      pains in their stummicks, an' twists an' yowls till you think they're
      goin' mad. When th' cops shut down on me, I has to give me cats to th'
      monk who's runnin' th' opium dump on th' top floor. Sure t'ing! They'd
      have croaked if I hadn't. They're on'y half happy, though; for while they
      gets their hop they misses me. Them toms an' me has had many a good
      smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Folks often wondered at the intimacy between Mike and Little Maxie&mdash;not
      that it has anything to do with this story. Little Maxie&mdash;his name on
      the Central Office books was Maxie Fyne, <i>alias</i> Maxie English, <i>alias</i>
      Little Maxie, <i>alias</i> Sharapatheck&mdash;was the opposite of Big
      Mike. He was small; he was weak; he didn't drink; he didn't hit the pipe.
      Also, at all times, and in cold blood, he was a professional thief. His
      wife, whom he called &ldquo;My Kytie&rdquo;&mdash;for Little Maxie was from
      Houndsditch, and now and then his accent showed it&mdash;was as good a
      thief as he, but on a different lay. Her specialty was robbing women. She
      worked alone, as all good gon-molls do, and because of her sure
      excellencies was known as the Golden Hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Maxie and his Golden Hand, otherwise his Kytie&mdash;her name was
      Kate&mdash;had a clean little house near Washington Square on the south.
      They owned a piano and a telephone&mdash;the latter was purely defensive&mdash;and
      their two children went to school, and sat book to book with the children
      of honest men and women.
    </p>

      The little quiet home, with its piano and defensive telephone, is gone
      now. Little Maxie died and his Golden Hand married again; for there's no
      false sentiment in Gangland. If a husband's dead he's dead, and there's
      nothing made by mourning. Likewise, what's most wanted in any husband is
      that he should be a live one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Maxie died in a rather curious way. Some say he was drowned by his
      pals, Big Mike among them. The story runs that there was a quarrel over
      splitting up a touch, and the mob charged Little Maxie with holding out.
      Be that as it may, the certainty is that Little Maxie and his mob, being
      in Peekskill, got exceeding drunk&mdash;all but Little Maxie&mdash;and
      went out in a boat. Being out, Little Maxie went overboard abruptly, and
      never came up. Neither did anybody go after him. The mob returned to town
      to weep&mdash;crocodile tears, some said&mdash;into their beer, as they
      told and re-told their loss, and in due time Little Maxie's body drifted
      ashore and was buried. That was the end. Had it been some trust-thief of a
      millionaire, there would have been an investigation. But Little Maxie was
      only a pick-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Mike, like all strong characters, had his weakness. His weakness was
      punching Chinamen; fairly speaking, it grew to be his fad. It wasn't
      necessary that a Chinaman do anything; it was enough that he came within
      reach. Mike would knock him cold. In a single saunter through Pell Street,
      he had been known to leave as many as four senseless Chinamen behind him,
      fruits of his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said Mike, in cheerful exposition of the motive which underlay that
      performance, &ldquo;I do so like to beat them monks about! I'd sooner slam one
      of 'em ag'inst th' wall than smoke th' pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One time and another Mike punched two-thirds of all the pig-tailed heads
      in Chinatown. Commonly he confined himself to punching, though once or
      twice he went a step beyond. Lee Dok he nearly brained with a stool. But
      Lee Dok had been insultingly slow in getting out of Mike's way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike was proud of his name and place as the Terror of Chinatown. Whether
      he walked in Mott or Pell or Doyers Street, every Chinaman who saw him
      coming went inside and locked his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who didn't see him and so go inside and dock their doors&mdash;and
      they were few&mdash;he promptly soaked. And if to see a Chinaman run was
      as incense to Mike's nose, to soak one became nothing less than a sweet
      morsel under his tongue. The wonder was that Mike didn't get shot or
      knifed, which miracle went not undiscussed at such centers as Tony's,
      Barney Flynn's, Jimmy Kelly's and the Chatham Club. But so it was; the
      pig-tailed population of Chinatown parted before Mike's rush like so much
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      One only had been known to resist&mdash;Sassy Sam, who with a dwarf's body
      possessed a giant's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sassy Sam was a hatchet-man of dread eminence, belonging to the Hip Sing
      Tong. Equipped of a Chinese sword, of singular yet murderous appearance,
      he chased Mike the length of Pell Street. Mike out-ran Sassy Sam, which
      was just as well. It took three shells of hop to calm Mike's perturbed
      spirit; for he confessed to a congenital horror of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's straight,&rdquo; said Mike, as with shaking fingers he filled his
      peanut-oil lamp, and made ready to cook himself a pill, &ldquo;I never could
      stand for a chive. An' say&rdquo;&mdash;he shuddered&mdash;&ldquo;that monk has: one
      longer'n your arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sassy Sam and his snickersnee, however, did not cure Mike of his weakness
      for punching the Mongolian head. Nothing short of death could have done
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some six months prior to his caving in the skull of Low Foo, because of those
      shirts improperly missing, Mike did that which led to consequences.
      Prompted by an overplus of sweet, heady Chinese rum, or perhaps it was the
      heroic example of Sassy Sam, Ling Tchen, being surprised by Mike in Pell
      Street, did not&mdash;pig-tail flying&mdash;clatter inside and lock his
      door. More and worse, he faced Mike, faced him, coughed contumeliously and
      spat upon the cobbles. To merely soak Ling Tchen would have been no
      adequate retort&mdash;Ling Tchen who thus studied to shame him. Wherefore
      Mike killed him with a clasp knife, and even went so far as to cut off the
      dead Tchen's head. The law might have taken notice of this killing, but
      some forethoughtful friend had had wit enough to tuck a gun beneath the
      dead Tchen's blouse, and thus it became at once and obviously a case of
      self-defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a loose screw in the killing of Ling Tchen. The loose screw
      dwelt not in the manner of that killing, which had been not only thorough
      but artistic. Indeed, cutting off Ling Tchen's head as a finale was
      nothing short of a stroke of genius. The loose screw was that Ling Tchen
      belonged to the Hip Sing Tong; and the Hip Sing Tongs lived in Pell
      Street, where Mike himself abode. To be sure, since Ling Tchen did the
      provoking, Mike had had no choice. Still, it might have come off better
      had Ling Tchen been an On Leon Tong. An On Leon Tong belongs in Mott
      Street and doesn't dare poke his wheat-hued nose into Pell Street, where
      the Four Brothers and the Hip Sing Tongs are at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike's room was in the rear, on the second floor of Number Twelve. It
      pleased and soothed him, he said, as he smoked a pill, to hear the muffled
      revelry below in Tony's. He had just come from his room upon that shirt
      occasion which resulted so disastrously for Low Fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike was among friends in Tony's. Having told in full how he did up Low
      Foo, and smashed that shirt thief's laundry, Mike drank two glasses of
      beer, and said that he thought now he'd go upstairs and have a smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be somethin' in lickin' a chink,&rdquo; expounded Mike, &ldquo;that makes
      a guy hanker for th' hop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's early yet; better stick 'round,&rdquo; urged Tony, politely. &ldquo;There is
      some high-rollers from Newport up here on a yacht, an' crazy to see
      Chinatown in th' summer when th' blankets is off. Th' dicks w'at's got 'em
      in tow, gives me th' tip that they'll come lungin' in here about ten.
      They're over in Mott Street now, takin' a peek at the joss house an'
      drinkin' tea in the Port Arthur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to meet 'em,&rdquo; declared Mike. &ldquo;Them stiffs makes me sick. If
      youse'd promise to lock th' doors, Tony, an' put 'em all in th' air for
      what they've got on 'em, I might stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'd be a wise play, I don't think,&rdquo; remarked the Dropper, who had just
      come in. &ldquo;Tony'd last about as long as a dollar pointin' stuss. Puttin' a
      chink on th' bum is easy, an' a guy can get away wit' it; but lay a finger
      on a Fift' Avenoo Willie-boy, or look cockeyed at a spark-fawney on th'
      finger of one of them dames, an' a judge'll fall over himself to hand
      youse twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right youse be, Dropper!&rdquo; said the sophistcated Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike climbed the creaking stairway to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, in Tony's, the beer, the gossip, the music, the singing and the
      dancing went on. Pretty Agnes sang a new song, and was applauded. That is,
      she was applauded by all save Mollie Squint, who uplifted her nose and
      said that &ldquo;it wasn't so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollie Squint was invited to sing, but refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten o'clock came the Newport contingent, fresh from quaffing tea and
      burning joss sticks. They were led by a she-captain of the Four Hundred,
      who shall go here as Mrs. Vee. Mrs. Vee, young, pretty, be-jeweled, was in
      top spirits. For she had just been divorced from her husband, and they put
      brandy into the Port Arthur tea if you tell them to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony did the honors for Number Twelve. He and Mrs. Vee, surrounded by a
      fluttering flock of purple doves, all from aristocratic cotes, became as
      thick as thieves. The Dropper, who was not wanting in good looks and could
      spiel like a dancing master, went twice around the room with Mrs. Vee&mdash;just
      for a lark, you know&mdash;to a tune scraped from Tony's fiddles and
      thumped from that publican's piano. After which, Mrs. Vee and her flutter
      of followers, Willieboys and all, went their purple way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony, with never flagging courtesy, escorted them to the door. What he
      beheld filled his somewhat sluggish soul with wonder. Pell Street was
      thronged with Chinamen. They were sitting or standing, all silent, faces
      void of meaning. The situation, too, was strange in this. A Chinaman could
      have told you that they were all of the Hip Sing Tong, and not a Four
      Brothers among them. He wouldn't of course, for a Chinaman tells a white
      devil nothing. Pell, by the way, was as much the home street of the Four
      Brothers as of the Hip Sing Tong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony expressed his astonishment at the pigtailed press which thronged the
      thoroughfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is how it is,&rdquo; vouchsafed the explanatory Tony to Mrs. Vee and her
      purple fluttering doves. &ldquo;Big Mike's just after standin' Low Foo's
      wash-shop on its nut, an' these monks are sizin' up th' wreck. When
      anything happens to a monk his tong makes good, see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tony might not have said this had he recalled that Low Foo was a Four
      Brothers, and understood that no one not a Hip Sing Tong was in the crowd.
      Tony, however, recalled nothing, understood nothing; for he couldn't tell
      one Chinaman from another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How interesting!&rdquo; cooed Mrs. Vee, in response to Tony's elucidation; and
      with that her flock of purple doves, in fluttering agreement, cooed, &ldquo;How
      interesting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did youse lamp th' ice on them dames?&rdquo; asked Sop Henry, when the slumming
      Mrs. Vee and her suite were out of ear-shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sop had an eye for diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That bunch ain't got a thing but money!&rdquo; observed the Wop, his eyes
      glittering enviously. &ldquo;I wisht I had half their cush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money ain't th' whole box of tricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This deep declaration emanated from old Jimmy. Old Jimmy's home was a rear
      room on Second Street near the Bowery, which overlooked a graveyard hidden
      in the heart of the block. There, when not restoring himself at Tony's or
      Sirocco's or Lyon's, old Jimmy smoked a vile tobacco known as Sailors'
      Choice, in a vile clay pipe as black as sin, and meditated. Having nothing
      to do but think, he evolved in time into a philosopher, and it became his
      habit to unload chunks of wisdom on whomsoever seemed to stand in need.
      Also, since he was warlike and carried a knife, and because anyone in hard
      luck could touch him for a dollar, he was listened to politely in what
      society he favored with his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money ain't th' whole box of tricks,&rdquo; old Jimmy repeated, severely,
      wagging a grizzled head at the Wop, &ldquo;an' only you're Irish an' ignorant
      you wouldn't have to be told so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy, you're nutty,&rdquo; returned the Wop. &ldquo;Never mind me bein' nutty,&rdquo;
       retorted old Jimmy, dogmatically. &ldquo;I know all about th' rich.&rdquo; Then, in
      forgetfulness of his pension and the liberal source of it, he continued:
      &ldquo;A rich man is so much like a fat hog that he's seldom any good until he's
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Jimmy called for beer; wisdom is always dry. &ldquo;Say?&rdquo; observed the
      Dropper, airily, &ldquo;do youse guys know that I'm thinkin' I'll just about cop
      off some dame with millions of dough, an' marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would she have youse?&rdquo; inquired Mollie Squint, with the flicker of a
      sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's easy money,&rdquo; returned the Dropper; &ldquo;all I has to do is put out me
      sign, see? Them rich frails would fall for me in a hully second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You crooks can't think of a thing but money,&rdquo; snorted old Jimmy. &ldquo;Marry a
      rich dame! A guy might as well get a job as valet or butler or footman
      somewhere an' let it go at that. Do you mutts know what love is? Th' one
      married chance of happiness is love. An' to love, folks must be poor. Then
      they have to depend upon each other; and it's only when people depend upon
      each other they love each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; quoth the Dropper, with mock sadness. &ldquo;I can see your finish.
      You'll land in Bloomingdale, playin' wit' a string of spools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever,&rdquo; demanded old Jimmy, disregarding the irreverent Dropper,
      &ldquo;see some strapping young party, up against the skyline on an iron
      building, workin' away wit' one of them rivetin' guns? Well, somewhere
      between th' two rivers there's a girl he's married to, who's doin' a
      two-step 'round a cook stove, fryin' steak an' onions for him, an' keepin'
      an eye out that their kids don't do a high dive off th' fire-escape. Them
      two people are th' happiest in th' world. Such boneheads as you can't
      appreciate it, but they are. Give 'em a million dollars an' you'll spoil
      it. They'd get a divorce; you'd put that household on th' toboggan. If
      this Mister Vee, now, had been poor an' drove a truck instead of bein'
      rich an' drivin' a 6-horse coach, an' if Mrs. Vee had been poor an' done a
      catch-as-catch-can with th' family washtub instead of havin' money to burn
      an' hirein' a laundress, she'd never have bucked th' divorce game, but
      lived happy ever after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Jimmy,&rdquo; interposed Tony, &ldquo;I've seen poor folks scrap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; assented Jimmy; &ldquo;all married folks scrap&mdash;a little. But
      them's only love spats, when they're poor. Th' wife begins 'em. She thinks
      she'll just about try hubby out, an' see can he go some. Th' only risk is
      him bein' weak enough to let her win. She don't want to win; victory would
      only embarrass her. What she's after is a protector; an' if hubby lets her
      put him on th' floor for th' count, she don't know where she's at. She's
      dead sure she's no good; an' if he's a quitter she's left all in th' air.
      Havin' floored him, she thinks to herself, 'This thing protect me? Why, I
      can lick him myself!' After that, hubby might better keep close tabs on
      little Bright-eyes, or some mornin' he'll call the family roll an' she
      won't answer. Take a boy an' a girl, both young, both square, both poor&mdash;so
      they'll need each ether&mdash;an', so he's got her shaded a little should
      it come to th' gloves, two bugs in a rug won't have nothin' on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Jimmy up-ended his glass, as one who had settled grave matters, while
      the Dropper and the Wop shook contemplative heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' yet,&rdquo; said the Wop, after a pause, &ldquo;goin' back to them rich babies
      who was here, I still say I wisht I had their bundle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's four for one,&rdquo; returned old Jimmy, his philosophy again forging to
      the fore&mdash;&ldquo;it's four for one, Wop, you'd have a dead bad time. What
      street shows th' most empty houses? Ain't it Fift' Ave-noo? Why be they
      empty? Because the ginks who lived in 'em didn't have a good time in 'em.
      If they had they'd have stuck. A guy don't go places, he leaves places. He
      don't go to Europe, he leaves New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Jimmy turned to Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fill up th' crockery. I'm talkin' 'way over th' heads of these bums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't he a wonder?&rdquo; whispered Pretty Agnes to the Nailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say as much,&rdquo; responded the admiring Nailer. &ldquo;He ought to be
      sellin' gold bricks. He's talked th' Dropper an' th' Wop into a hard
      knot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dropper was not to be quelled, and insisted that Jimmy was conversing
      through his sou'wester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; broke in Jew Yetta; &ldquo;I strings wit' Jimmy. Take a
      tumble to yourself, Dropper. If you was to marry one of them money dames,
      you'd have to go into high society. An' then what? W'y, you'd look like a
      pig on a front porch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't youse bet on it,&rdquo; declared the Dropper loftily. &ldquo;There's nothin' in
      that high society stuff. A smart guy like me could learn his way t'rough
      in a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could he?&rdquo; said the Nailer, and his tones were tones of derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's w'at I says!&rdquo; replied the Dropper. Then, heatedly: &ldquo;W'y, do you
      geeks think I've never been north of Fourteenth Street? Youse make me
      tired, Nailer. While you was up-th'-river, for toinin' off that loft in
      Chambers Street, don't I go to a shindy at th' Demmycrat Club in honor of
      Sen'tor Depew? There was loidies there&mdash;th' real thing, too. An'
      wasn't I another time at th' Charlie Murphy dinner? Talk of high society!&mdash;if
      that ain't high society, what is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having squelched the Nailer, the Dropper proceeded more moderately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember th' scare that's t'run into me at the Depew racket. I've been
      put up ag'inst some hot propositions, but if ever I'm faded it's then
      when, for th' foist time, I lamps a full-blown dame in evenin' dress. On
      th' dead, I felt like yellin' 'Police!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phwat was it scared yez, Dropper?&rdquo; asked the Wop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't that I'm so scared as rattled. There's too much free-board to
      them evenin' dresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' the Charlie Murphy banquet,&rdquo; said Pretty Agnes, wistfully. &ldquo;Didn't
      yez get cold feet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw, I don't git cold feet. I admits I falls down, I don't try to
      sidestep that; but it wasn't my fault. Do it over again, an' I'd go
      t'rough wit' bells on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did youse fall down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's be accident; I takes th' wrong steer, that's all. I makes it a
      point, knowin' I'm none too wise, to plant meself when we pulls up to the
      feed opposite to a gilded old bunk, who looked like ready money. 'Do as he
      does, Dropper' I says to meself, 'an' you're winner in a walk!' So, when
      he plays a fork, I plays a fork; if he boards a chive, I boards a chive;
      from soup to birds I'm steerin' be his wake. Then all of a sudden I cops a
      shock. We've just made some roast squabs look like five cents worth of
      lard in a paper bag, an' slopped out a bunch of fizz to wash 'em down,
      when what does that old Rube do but up an' sink his hooks in a bowl of
      water. Honest, I like to 've fell in a fit! There I'd been feelin' as
      cunning as a pet fox, an' me on a dead one from th' jump!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any of them smart Alecks give youse th' laugh?&rdquo; asked the Nailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me th' laugh,&rdquo; repeated the Dropper, disgustedly. &ldquo;I'd have smashed
      whoever did in th' eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While beer and conversation were flowing in Number Twelve, a sophisticated
      eye would have noted divers outside matters which might or might not have
      had a meaning. On the heels of Big Mike's laundry deeds of desolation and
      destruction at Low Foo's, not a Chinaman was visible in Pell Street. It
      was the same when Mike came out of Tony's and climbed the stairs to his
      room. Mike safely retired from the field, a handful of Four Brothers&mdash;all
      of them Lows and of the immediate clan of Low Foo&mdash;showed up, and
      took a slanteyed squint at what ruin had been wrought. They spoke not
      above a murmur, but as nearly as a white devil might gather a meaning,
      they were of the view that no monsoon could have more thoroughly
      scrap-heaped the belongings of Low Foo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other Chinamen began to gather, scores upon scores. These were Hip Sing
      Tongs, and they paid not the slightest heed to Low Foo's laundry, or what
      was left of it. What Four Brothers were abroad did not mingle with the Hip
      Sing Tongs, although the two tribes lived in friendship. The Four Brothers
      quietly withdrew, each to his own den, and left the Hip Sing Tongs in
      possession of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in possession, the Hip Sing Tongs did nothing beyond roost on the
      curb, or squat in doorways, or stand idly about. Now and then one smoked a
      cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      About 11.20 o'clock, a Chinaman entered Pell Street from the Bowery. Every
      one of the Hip Sing Tongs looked at him; none of them spoke to him. Only,
      a place was made for him in the darkness of the darkest doorway. Had some
      brisk Central Office intelligence been there and consulted its watch, it
      might have occurred to such intelligence that had the newcomer arrived
      from Philadelphia over the B. &amp; O. by latest train, he&mdash;assuming
      him to have taken the ferry with proper dispatch&mdash;would have come
      poking into Pell Street at precisely that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trinity struck midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bells sounded dim and far away. It was as though it were the ghost of
      some dead midnight being struck. At the sound, and as if he heard in it a
      signal, the mysterious Chinaman came out of the double darkness of the
      doorway in which he had been waiting, and crossed to the stairway that led
      up to the room of Mike. Not a whisper came from the waiting Hip Sing
      Tongs, who watched him with that blend of apathy and eagerness observable
      only in the Oriental. No one went with the mysterious Chinaman. Nor did
      the stairs creak&mdash;as with Big Mike&mdash;beneath his velvet shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mysterious one emerged from Mike's stairway as silently as he had
      entered it. He tossed a claw-like hand palm outward, toward the waiting,
      watching Hip Sing Tongs, and then went slippering towards the Bowery. Had
      that brisk Central Office intelligence been there to see, it might have
      reflected, recalling a time table, that by taking the Cortlandt Street
      ferry, the mysterious one would be in time for the 12.30 train to
      Philadelphia over the Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the mysterious one had reached the Bowery, those scores of waiting,
      watching Hip Sing Tongs had vanished, and Pell Street was as empty as the
      promise of a politician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; whispered Ching Lee to Sam Kum, who kept the chop suey shop, as
      they turned to go&mdash;&ldquo;now he meet Ling Tchen, mebby so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony began to think about locking his front door. This, out of respect for
      the law. Not that beer and revelry were to cease in Number Twelve, but
      because such was Tony's understanding with the precinct skipper. Some
      reformer might come snooping else, and lodge complaint against that
      skipper with the Commissioner of Police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Tony, on bidding &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; to Mrs. Vee and her purple fluttering
      flock, had been impressed by the crowded condition of Pell Street, so now,
      when he made ready to lock up, was he impressed by that causeway's
      profound emptiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he cried to his guests in the rear, &ldquo;you stews come here! This is
      funny; there ain't a chink in sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'youse think th' bulls are gettin' ready for a raid?&rdquo; asked Sop Henry.
      Sop, with the Nailer and the Wop, had joined Tony in the door. &ldquo;Perhaps
      there's somethin' doin' over at th' Elizabeth Street station, an' the
      wardman's passed th' monks th' tip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin' in that,&rdquo; responded Tony, confidently. &ldquo;Wouldn't I be put wise,
      too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marvelling much, Tony fastened his door, and joined old Jimmy, Pretty
      Agnes and the others in the rear room. When he got there, he found old
      Jimmy sniffing with suspicious nose, and swearing he smelled gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your pipes is leakin', Tony,&rdquo; said Jimmy, &ldquo;leakin' for fair, too,
      or I'm a Dago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tony, in refutation, called attention to a patent truth. He used electric
      light, not gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they use gas upstairs,&rdquo; he added. Then, half-anxiously; &ldquo;It can't be
      some hop-head has blown out the gas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought was enough to start the Dropper, ever full of enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's have a look,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Nailer you an' th' Wop come wit' me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tony again opened the front door, and the Dropper, followed by the Wop and
      the Nailer, filed into the stairway that led to the floor above. They made
      noise enough, blundering and stumbling in the sudden hurry of spirit which
      had gripped them. As they reached the landing near Mike's door, the odor
      of gas was even more pronounced than in Tony's rear room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall was blind black with the thick darkness that filled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about this?&rdquo; queried the Dropper. &ldquo;I thought a gas jet was always
      boinin' in th' hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dropper, growing fearful, hung back. With that, the Wop pushed forward
      and took the lead. Only for a moment. Giving a cry, he sprang back with
      such sudden force that he sent the Dropper headlong down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' Virgin save us!&rdquo; exclaimed the Wop, &ldquo;but I touched somethin' soft!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's th' row?&rdquo; demanded Tony, coming to the foot of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Dropper's request, Tony brought a candle, used by him in excursions
      to those crypts wherein he kept his whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment all was plain. That something soft which had so told upon the
      Wop was a rubber tube. There was a gas jet in the hall. One end of the
      rubber tube had been fastened over the gas jet, and the other stuffed into
      the keyhole of Mike's door. Trap arranged, the gas had been set flowing
      full blast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do youse think of that?&rdquo; exclaimed Tony, who understood at a
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one swift move, Tony turned off the gas and tore away the rubber
      tube. There was no talk of keys. He placed his powerful shoulder against
      the door, and sent it crashing. The out-rush of gas drove them, choking
      and gasping, into the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it from me,&rdquo; said the Dropper, as soon as he could get his breath,
      &ldquo;they've croaked Mike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the window,&rdquo; urged the Nailer; &ldquo;mebbe Mike has the window open!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a chance!&rdquo; retorted the Dropper. &ldquo;No one has his window up while he
      hits th' pipe. They don't jibe, fresh air an' dope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dropper was right. Big Mike, stark and still and yellow, lay dead in
      his bed&mdash;the last place his friends would have anticipated&mdash;poisoned
      by gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better notify th' cops,&rdquo; advised Jimmy, the practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; sobbed Pretty Agnes. &ldquo;Mike never handed it to himself.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; repeated the Dropper, bitterly. &ldquo;Th' chinks did it. It's for
      Low Foo's laundry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're down wrong, Dropper,&rdquo; said old Jimmy. &ldquo;It's that Ling Tchen trick.
      I knew them Hip Sings would get Mike.&rdquo;

      XII.&mdash;THE GOING OF BIFF ELLISON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he jury returned a
      verdict of guilty. Thereupon the judge, fixing Ellison with hard and
      thoughtful eye, gave him &ldquo;from eight to twenty years.&rdquo; When a man gets
      &ldquo;from eight to twenty years&rdquo; he is worth writing about. He would be worth
      writing about, even though it had been for such crimes of the commonplace
      as poke-getting at a ferry or sticking up a drunken sailor. And Ellison
      was found guilty of manslaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razor Riley would have been sentenced along with Ellison, only he had
      conveniently died. When the Gophers gather themselves together, they give
      various versions of Razor Riley's taking off. Some say he perished of
      pneumonia. Others lay it to a bullet in his careless mouth. In any case,
      he was dead, and therefore couldn't, in the nature of things, accompany
      Ellison to Sing Sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razor was a little one-hundred-and-ten-pound man, with weak muscles and a
      heart of fire. He had, razorwise, cut and slashed his way into much
      favorable mention, when that pneumonia or bullet&mdash;whichever it was&mdash;stopped
      short his career.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the width of the city apart, he and Ellison were ever friends. They
      drank together, fought together, and held their foes as they held their
      money, in common.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the jury said &ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; it filled Ellison with resentful amazement.
      His angry wonder grew as the judge coldly mentioned that &ldquo;from eight
      to-twenty years.&rdquo; He couldn't understand! The politicians had promised to
      save him. It was only upon such assurance that he had concluded to return.
      Safe in Baltimore, he could have safely continued in Baltimore. Lured by
      false lights, misled by spurious promises, he had come back to get &ldquo;from
      eight to twenty years!&rdquo; Cray and Savage rounded him up. All his life a
      cop-fighter, he would have given those Central Office stars a battle, had
      he realized what was in store for him and how like a rope of sand were the
      promises of politicians!
    </p>
    <p>
      My own introduction to Ellison and Razor Riley was in the Jefferson Market
      court. That was several years ago. The day was the eighteenth of March,
      and Magistrate Corrigan had invited me to a seat on the bench. Ellison and
      Razor were arraigned for disorderly conduct. They had pushed in the door
      of a Sixth Avenue bird and animal store, kept by an agitated Italian, and
      in the language of the officer who made the collar, &ldquo;didn't do a thing to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are guilty, your honor,&rdquo; said their lawyer, manner deprecatory and
      full of conciliation, with a view to softening the magisterial heart&mdash;&ldquo;they
      are guilty. And yet there is this in their defense. They had been
      celebrating Saint Patrick's Day, over-celebrating it, perhaps, your honor,
      and they didn't know what they were about. That's the mere truth, your
      honor. Befuddled by too much and too fervently celebrating the glorious
      day, they really didn't know what they were about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer waved a virtuous hand, as one who submitted affairs to the
      mercy of an enlightened court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magistrate Corrigan was about to impose sentence, when the agitated
      Italian broke forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't I get-a my chance, judge?&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; returned
      Magistrate Corrigan, &ldquo;what is it you want to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge, that-a guy&rdquo;&mdash;pointing the finger of rebuttal at the lawyer&mdash;&ldquo;he
      say theese mans don't know what-a they do. One lie! They know what-a they
      do all right. I show you, judge. They smash-a th' canaries, they knock-a
      th' blocks off-a th' monks, they tear-a th' tails out of th' macaws, but&rdquo;&mdash;here
      his voice rose to a screech&mdash;&ldquo;they nevair touch-a th' bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Magistrate Corrigan glanced at the policeman. The latter explained that,
      while Ellison and Razor had spread wreck and havoc among the monkeys and
      macaws, they had avoided even a remotest entanglement with a huge cinnamon
      bear, chained in the center of the room. They had prudently plowed 'round
      the bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five and costs!&rdquo; said Magistrate Corrigan, a smile touching the
      corners of his mouth. Then, raising a repressive palm towards the lawyer,
      who betrayed symptoms of further oratory: &ldquo;Not a word. Your people get off
      very lightly. Upon the point you urge that these men didn't know what they
      were about, the testimony of our Italian friend is highly convincing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When a gentleman goes to Sing Sing for longer than five years, it is
      Gangland good manners to speak of him in the past tense. Thus, then, shall
      I speak of Ellison. His name, properly laid down, was James Ellison. As,
      iron on wrists, a deputy at his elbow, he stepped aboard the train, he
      gave his age as thirty-nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      His monaker of Biff came to him in the most natural way in the world.
      Gangland is ever ready to bestow a title. Therefore, when a recalcitrant
      customer of Fat Flynn's, having quaffed that publican's beer and then
      refused to pay for it, was floored as flat as a flounder by a round blow
      from Ellison's fist, Gangland, commemorating the event, renamed him Biff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellison was in his angular, awkward twenties when he made his initial
      appearance along the Bowery. He came from Maryland, no one knew why and a
      youthful greenness would have got him laughed at, had it not been for a
      look in his eye which suggested that while he might be green he might be
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having little education and no trade Ellison met existence by hiring out
      as bar-keeper to Fat Flynn, who kept a grog shop of singular vileness at
      34 Bond. Its beer glasses were vulgarly large, its frequenters of the
      rough-neck school. But it was either work in Flynn's or carry a hod, and
      Ellison, who was not fanatically fond of hard labor, and preferred to seek
      his bread along lines of least resistance, instantly and instinctively
      resolved on the side of Flynn's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gangland is much more given to boxing gloves than books, and the
      conversation at Flynn's, as it drifted across the bar to Ellison&mdash;busy
      drawing beer&mdash;was more calculated to help his hands than help his
      head. Now and then, to be sure, there would come one who, like Slimmy, had
      acquired a stir education, that is, a knowledge of books such as may be
      picked up in prison; but for the most those whom Ellison met, in the
      frothy course of business, were not the ones to feed his higher nature or
      elevate his soul. It was a society where the strong man was the best man,
      and only fist-right prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellison was young, husky, with length of reach and plenty of hitting
      power, and, as the interests of Flynn demanded, he bowed to his
      environment and beat up many a man. There were those abroad in Bond Street
      whom he could not have conquered. But, commonly sober and possessed
      besides of inborn gifts as a matchmaker, he had no trouble in avoiding
      these. The folks whom he hooked up with were of the <i>genus</i> cinch, <i>species</i>
      pushover, and proceeding carefully he built up in time a standing for
      valor throughout all the broad regions lying between Fourteenth Street and
      City Hall Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it be said that Ellison had courage. It was his prudence which taught
      him to hold aloof from the tough ones. Now and then, when a tough one did
      insist on war, Ellison never failed to bear himself with spirit. Only he
      preferred to win easily, with little exertion and no injury to his nose
      and eyes. For Ellison, proud of his appearance, was by Gangland's crude
      standards the glass of fashion and the mould of form, and flourished the
      idol of the ladies. Also, a swollen nose or a discolored eye is of no
      avail in winning hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every dispenser of beer is by way of being a power in politics. Some soar
      higher, some with weaker wing&mdash;that is a question of genius. One
      sells beer and makes himself chief of Tammany Hall. Another rises on the
      tides of beer to a district leadership. Still others&mdash;and it is here
      that Ellison comes in&mdash;find their lower beery level as Tammany's
      shoulder-hitting aides.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last rôle, Ellison was of value to Tammany Hall. Wherefore,
      whenever he fell into the fingers of the police&mdash;generally for
      assault&mdash;the machine cast over him the pinion of its prompt
      protection. As the strong-arm pet of the organization, he punched and
      slugged, knocked down and dragged out, and did all these in safety. Some
      soft-whispering politician was sure to show a magistrate&mdash;all ears&mdash;that
      the equities were on the side of Ellison, and what black eyes or broken
      noses had been distributed went where they truly belonged and would do the
      most Tammany good.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his double role of beer dispenser and underthug of politics, Ellison
      stood high in Gangland opinion. From Flynn's in Bond Street he went to
      Pickerelle's in Chrystie Street. Then he became the presiding influence at
      a dive of more than usual disrepute kept by one Landt, which had flung
      open its dingy doors in Forsyth Street near Houston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellison' took an impressive upward step at this time. That is, he nearly
      killed a policeman. Nicely timing matters so that the officer was looking
      the other way, he broke a bottle over the blue-coat's head. The blue-coat
      fell senseless to the floor. Once down and helpless, Ellison hoofed him
      after the rules of Gangland, which teach that only fools are fair, until
      the hoofed one was a pick-up for an ambulance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer spent two weeks in a hospital cot, Ellison two hours in a
      station house cell. The politicians closed the officer's mouth, and opened
      Ellison's cell. The officer got well after a while, and he and Ellison
      grew to be good friends. The politicians said that there was nothing in it
      for either the officer or Ellison to remain at loggerheads. No man may
      write himself &ldquo;politician&rdquo; who does not combine the strength to prosecute
      a war, with the wisdom to conclude a peace. Hence, at the command of the
      politicians, Ellison and the smitten officer struck hands, and pooled
      their differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellison, smooth-faced, high-featured, well-dressed, a Gangland cavalier,
      never married. Or if he did he failed to mention it. He was not a
      moll-buzzer; no one could accuse him of taking money from a woman. He
      lived by the ballot and the bung-starter. In addition once a year he gave
      a racket, tinder the auspices of what he called the &ldquo;Biff Ellison
      Association,&rdquo; and as his fame increased his profits from a single racket
      were known to reach $2,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time Ellison challenged fortune as part proprietor of Paresis Hall,
      which sink of sin, as though for contrast, had been established within the
      very shadow of Cooper Union. Terminating his connection with Paresis Hall,
      he lived a life of leisure between Chick Tricker's Park Row &ldquo;store&rdquo; and
      Nigger Mike's at Number Twelve Pell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally he so far unbuckled as to escort some lady to or from
      Sharkey's in Fourteenth Street. Not as a lobbygow; not for any ill-odored
      fee of fifty cents. But as a gentleman might, and out of sheer politeness.
      The law, as enforced from Mulberry Street, was prone to take a narrow view
      of ladies who roamed alone the midnight streets. The gallant Ellison was
      pleasantly willing to save night-bound dames of his acquaintance from this
      annoyance. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who has not heard of the celebrated Paul Kelly? Once upon a time, a good
      woman reading a newspaper saw reference to Paul Kelly in some interesting
      connection. She began to burn with curiosity; she wanted to meet Paul
      Kelly, and said so to her husband. Since her husband had been brought up
      to obey her in all things, he made no objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guided by a pathfinder from the Central Office, the gentleman went forth
      to find Paul Kelly, his wife on his arm. They entered Lyon's restaurant in
      the Bowery; the place was crowded. Room was made for them at a table by
      squeezing in three chairs. The lady looked about her. Across, stale and
      fat and gone to seed, sat an ex-eminent of the prize ring. At his elbow
      was a stocky person, with a visage full of wormwood and a chrysanthemum
      ear. He of the ear was given to misguided volubilities, more apt to
      startle than delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman who wanted to see Paul Kelly looked at the champion gone to
      sulky seed, listened to the misguided conversationist with the
      chrysanthemum ear, and wished she hadn't come. She might have been driven
      from the field, had it not been for a small, dark personage, with black
      eyes and sallow cheeks, who sat next her on the left. His voice was low
      and not alarming; his manner bland but final. And he took quiet and
      quieting charge of the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark, sallow little man led those two others in the wordy way they
      should go. When the talk of him of the unsatisfactory ear approached the
      Elizabethan so closely as to inspire terror, he put him softly yet
      sufficiently back in his hole. Also, when not thus employed, in holding
      down the conversational lid, he talked French to one man, Italian to
      another, English to all. Purringly polite, Chesterfield might have studied
      him with advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman who wanted to see Paul Kelly was so taken with the little dark
      man's easy mastery of the situation, that she forgot the object of the
      expedition. When she was again in the street, and had drawn a deep, clear
      breath or two of long relief, she expressed astonishment that one
      possessed of so much grace and fineness, so full of cultured elegancies,
      should be discovered in such coarse surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, he doesn't belong there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; repeated the Central Office delegate in a discouraged tone.
      &ldquo;I thought your hubby wised you up. That's Paul Kelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Kelly owned the New Brighton in Great Jones Street. One evening, as
      the orchestra was tuning its fiddles for the final <i>valse</i>, a sudden
      but exhaustive bombardment then and there broke loose. In the hot midst of
      it, some cool hand turned off the lights. They were never again turned on.
      The guests departed through window and by way of door, and did not come
      back. It was the end of the New Brighton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gangland, which can talk betimes, can also keep a secret. Coax, cozen,
      cross-question as you will, you cannot worm from it the secret of that New
      Brighton bombardment. Ask, and every one is silent. There is a silence
      which is empty, there is a silence which is full. Those who will not tell
      why the New Brighton was shot up that night are silent with the silence
      which is full.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, the Central Office is not without its theories. The Central
      Office is often without the criminal, but never without the explanation.
      One Mulberry Street whisper declared that it was a war over a woman,
      without saying which woman. Another whisper insisted that money lay at the
      roots of the business, without saying what money. Still another ran to the
      effect that it was one of those hit-or-miss mix-ups, in their sort
      extemporaneous, in their up-come inexplicable, the distinguishing mark of
      which is an utter lack of either rhyme or reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      One officer with whom I talked pointed to Ellison and Harrington as the
      principals. Paul Kelly, he said, was drawn into it as incident to his
      proprietorship of the New Brighton, while the redoubtable Razor became
      part of the picture only through his friendship for Ellison. Another
      officer, contradicting, argued that there had been a feud of long standing
      between Razor and Paul Kelly; that Ellison was there in Razor's behalf,
      and Harrington got killed because he butted in. Both officers agreed that
      the rumpus had nothing to do with Eat-'em-up-Jack's run in with Chick
      Tricker, then sundry months astern, or the later lead-pipe wiping out of
      Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of the taking off of Eat-'em-up-Jack has already been told. The
      New Brighton missed Jack. He whom Paul Kelly brought to fill his place no
      more than just rattled about in it. The new sheriff did not possess Jack's
      nice knowledge of dance hall etiquette, and his blackjack lacked decision.
      Some even think that had Jack been there that night, what follows might
      never have occurred at all. As said one who held this view:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Eat-'em-up-Jack had been holdin' down th' floor, th' New Brighton
      wouldn't have looked so easy to Biff an' Razor, an' they might have passed
      it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dancing floor of the New Brighton was crowded with Gangland chivalry
      and fashion. Out in the bar, where waiters came rushing bearing trays of
      empty glasses to presently rushingly retire loaded to the beery guards,
      sat Paul Kelly and a select bevy. The talk was of business mixed with
      politics, for a campaign was being waged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After election,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;I'm going to close up this joint. I've got
      enough; I'm going to pack in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's th' row?&rdquo; asked Slimmy, who had drawn up a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's too much talking,&rdquo; returned Paul. &ldquo;Only the other day a bull was
      telling me that I'm credited with being the first guy along the Bowery to
      carry a gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's crazy,&rdquo; broke in Harrington, who with the lovely Goldie Cora had
      joined the group. &ldquo;There were cannisters by the ton along the Bowery
      before ever you was pupped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Irish Wop, whose mind ran altogether upon politics, glanced up from a
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spakin' av th' campaign,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how comes it things is so quiet? No
      one givin' th' banks a bawlin' out, no one soakin' th' railroads, no one
      handin' th' hot wallops to th' trusts! Phwat's gone wrong wit' 'em? I've
      found but wan man&mdash;jusht wan&mdash;bein' th' skate who's writin' in
      th' pa-a-aper here,&rdquo;&mdash;and the Wop held up the paper as Exhibit A&mdash;&ldquo;who
      acts loike he has somethin' to hand out. Lishten: After buck-dancin' a
      bit, he ups and calls Willyum Jinnins Bryan th' 'modern Brutus,' says
      'Cæsarism is abroad,' an' that Willyum Jinnins is th' only laddybuck who
      can put it on th' bum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's one of them hot-air students,&rdquo; said Harrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about this Brutus-Cæsar thing? Are they wit' th' organization?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's what a swell mouth-piece like Bourke Cock-ran calls a 'figger of
      speech',&rdquo; interjected Slimmy, ever happy to be heard concerning the
      ancients. &ldquo;Cesar an' Brutus were a couple of long-ago Dagoes. Accordin' to
      th' dope they lived an' croaked two thousand years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a pair av old wops, was they! An' dead an' gone at that! Sure I
      thought be th' way this writin' gezebo carried on about 'em they was right
      here on th' job, cuttin' ice. An' they're nothin' more'n a brace av old
      dead Guineas after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wop mused a moment over the unprofitable meanness of the discovery.
      Then his curiosity began to brighten up a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did yez come to be so hep to 'em, Slimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be studyin'&mdash;how-else? An' then there's Counsellor Noonan. You ought
      to hear him when he gets to goin' about Brutus and Cæsar an' th' rest of
      th' Roman fleet. To hear Noonan you'd think he had been one of their
      pals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' Counsellor's from Latrim,&rdquo; said the Wop; &ldquo;I'm a Mayo man meself. An'
      say, thim Latrim la-a-ads are th' born liars. Still, as long as the
      Counsellor's talkin' about phwat happened two thousand years ago, yez can
      chance a bet on him. It's only when he's repo-o-rtin' th' evints av
      yisterday he'll try to hand yez a lemon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wisht I was as wise as youse, Slimmy,&rdquo; said Goldie Cora, wistfully
      rubbing her delicate nose. &ldquo;It must be dead swell to know about Cæsar an'
      th' rest of them dubs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they was to show up now,&rdquo; hazarded the Wop, &ldquo;thim ould fellies 'ud
      feel like farmers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; observed Slimmy: &ldquo;they was lyin', cheatin', swindlin',
      snitchin', double-crossin' an' givin' each other th' rinkey-dink in th'
      old days same as now. This Cæsar, though, must have been a stiff
      proposition. He certainly woke up young! When he's only nineteen, he toins
      out one mornin', yawns, puts on his everyday toga, rambles down town, an'
      makes a hurrah touch for five million of dollars. Think of it!&mdash;five
      million!&mdash;an' him not twenty! He certainly was a producer&mdash;Cæsar
      was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should yell,&rdquo; assented Harrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' then phwat?&rdquo; asked the Wop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This what,&rdquo; said Slimmy. &ldquo;Havin' got his wad together, Cæsar starts in to
      light up Rome, an' invites the push to cut in. When he's got 'em properly
      keyed up, he goes into the forum an' says, 'Am I it?' An' the gang yells,
      'You're it'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cæsar could go some,&rdquo; commented Goldie Cora, admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rome's a republic then,&rdquo; Slimmy went on, &ldquo;an' Cæsar has himself elected
      the main squeeze. He declares for a wide-open town; his war cry is 'No
      water! No gas! No police!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, he was a live one!&rdquo; broke in Harrington; &ldquo;he was Rome's Big Tim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Goldie Cora, shaking her yellow head at Harrington.
      &ldquo;Go on, Slimmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About this time Brutus commences to show in th' runnin'. Brutus is th'
      head of th' Citizens' Union, an' him an' his fellow mugwumps put in their
      time bluffin' an' four-flushin' 'round about reform. They had everybody
      buffaloed, except Cæsar. Brutus is for closin' th' saloons, puttin' th'
      smother on horse racin', an' wants every Roman kid who plays baseball
      Sunday pinched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gives me a pain!&rdquo; complained Goldie Cora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' mind you, all th' time Brutus is graftin' with both hooks. He's in on
      the Aqueduct; he manages a forty per cent, hold out on the Appian way; an'
      what long green he has loose he loans to needy skates in Spain at pawn
      shop rates, an' when they don't kick in he uses the legions to collect.
      Brutus is down four ways from the jack on everything in sight. Nothin's
      calculated to embarrass him but a pair of mittens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' at that,&rdquo; remarked Harrington, who had a practical knowledge of
      politics, &ldquo;him an' his mugwump bunch didn't have nothin' on th' New York
      reformers. Do youse guys remember when the city bought th' ferries? There
      was&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd sooner hear Slimmy,&rdquo; said Goldie Cora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; agreed the Wop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slimmy looked flattered. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;all this time Caesar
      is the big screech, an' it makes Brutus so sore he gets to be a bug. So he
      starts to talkin'. 'This Cæsar guy,' says Brutus, 'won't do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Right you be,' says Cassius, who's always been a kicker. 'That's what
      I've been tellin' you lobsters from th' jump.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With this an old souse named Casca sits up, an' says he ain't seen
      nothin' wrong about Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, roll over!' says Cassius. 'Why even the newsboys are on. You know
      Cæsar's wardman&mdash;that fresh baby, Mark Antony? It's ribbed up right
      now that at th' Lupercal he's to hand Cæsar a crown.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Casca an' th' other bone-heads turns to Brutus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' says Brutus, answerin' their looks; 'Cassius has got good
      information. He's givin' youse th' correct steer.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' did Cæsar cop off the crown?&rdquo; asked Goldie Cora, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slimmy shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' Lupercal comes 'round,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an' Mark Antony is there with bells
      on. He makes a funny crack or two about a crown, but nothin' goes. Th'
      wind-up is that Brutus, Cassius, Casca, an' th' rest of th' Citizens'
      Union, gang Cæsar later in th' forum, go at him with their chives, an' cut
      an' slash till his hide won't hold his principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' wasn't there,&rdquo; demanded the Wop, with heat, &ldquo;so much as wan
      strong-arm la-a-ad up at Cæsar's end av th' alley, wit' th' nerve to git
      even?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear!&rdquo; returned Slimmy, reassuringly; &ldquo;th' day they plant Cæsar,
      Mark Antony goes in to make th' funeral spiel. He's th' Roman Senator
      Grady, Mark Antony is, an' he burns 'em up. Brutus an' his bunch get th'
      tip up at their club house, an' take it on th' run. With that, Cæsar's
      gang gets to goin', an' they stand Rome on its nut from the Capitoline
      Hill to the Tarpeian Rock. Brutus an' the' other mugwumps gets it where
      th' baby wore th' beads, an' there ain't been a Seth Low or a Fulton
      Cutting along th' Tiber from that day to this. Oh, they've got us left
      standin' sideways, them Guineas have, in some things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About the time Slimmy began his lucid setting forth of Brutus, Cæsar and
      their political differences, Ellison and Razor, down at Nigger Mike's in
      Pell Street, were laying their heads together. A bottle of whiskey stood
      between them, for they required inspiration. There were forty people in
      the room, some dancing, some drinking, some talking. But no one came near
      Ellison and Razor, for their manner showed that they did not wish to be
      disturbed. As the Nailer observed, &ldquo;They had a hen on,&rdquo; and when gentlemen
      have a hen on they prefer being quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've no use for Paul Kelly,&rdquo; whispered Razor in response to some remark
      of Ellison's. &ldquo;You bet he knows enough not to show his snout along Eighth
      Avenue. He'd get it good if he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My notion,&rdquo; said Ellison, &ldquo;is to turn th' trick right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just th' two of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd have his guerillas; youse have got to figure on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn't stand th' gaff. It's the difference between guys who knows
      what they wants, and guys who don't. Once we started, they'd tear th' side
      out the Brighton in the get-away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Razor, bringing down his hand; &ldquo;I'm wit' you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; and Ellison motioned Razor back into his chair. &ldquo;If
      Paul's dancin', we must stall him into th' bar. I don't want to hoit any
      of them skirts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the delightful habit of Slimmy, on the tail of one of his lectures,
      to order beer for his hearers. That's why he was listened to with so much
      interest. Were every lecturer to adopt Slimmy's plan, he would never fail
      of an audience. Also, his fame would grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slimmy, having finished with Cæsar and the others, had just signed up to
      the waiter to go his merry rounds, when Ellison and Razor slipped in from
      the street. Their hands were on their guns, their eyes on Kelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrington saw it coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gatt, Paul, your gatt!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rule in Gangland is to let every man kill his own snakes. Harrington's
      conduct crowded hard upon the gross. It so disgusted Razor that, to show
      Harrington what he thought of it, he half turned and laced a bullet
      through his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you've got something of your own to occupy your mind,&rdquo; quoth Razor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellison was too old a practitioner to be drawn aside by the Harrington
      episode. He devoted himself unswervingly to Paul Kelly. Ellison's first
      bullet cut a hole through Kelly's coat and did no further harm. The lights
      were switched out at this crisis, and what shooting followed came off in
      the dark. There was plenty of it. The air seemed sown as thickly full of
      little yellow spits of flame as an August swamp of fireflies. Even so, it
      didn't last. It was as short lived as a July squall at sea. There was one
      thunder and lightning moment, during which the pistols flashed and roared,
      and then&mdash;stillness and utter silence!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fairish pistol practice when you consider conditions. Paul Kelly
      had three bullets in him when four weeks later he asked the coppers to
      come and get him. He had been up in Harlem somewhere lying low. And you
      are not to forget Harrington. There were other casualties, also, which the
      police and politicians worked hand in hand to cover up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes went by after the shooting; ten minutes!&mdash;no one was in
      a hurry. At last a policeman arrived. He might have come sooner, but the
      New Brighton was a citadel of politics. Would you have had him lose his
      shield?
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman felt his official way into the barroom:&mdash;empty as a
      drum, dark as the inside of a cow!
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck a match. By its pale and little light he made out the dead
      Harrington on the floor. Not a living soul, not even Goldie Cora!
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldie Cora?
    </p>
    <p>
      Said that practical damsel, when the matter was put up to her by Big
      Kitty, who being sentimental called Goldie Cora a quitter for leaving her
      dead love lying in his blood, &ldquo;What good could I do? If I'd stuck I'd have
      got pinched; an' then&mdash;me in th' Tombs&mdash;I'd have stood a swell
      chance, I don't chink, of bein' at Bill's funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
